He tested into Calc III, Physics II, and completely out of Chem and several GEs. He printed his curriculum sheet and traced through all of the prerequisites from senior project, backwards through his entire curriculum, to plot the most efficient path. There was no way to cut it below 4 years. He took a couple of light quarters (12 hours) and still only had 15 of 45 quarter hours left his senior year. The problem was, half of them were senior project. He decided to use his time taking graduate classes and will walk with a BS/MS in about 4.5 years.\nWhat ends up happening in an engineering curriculum is that a lot of the GE hours go unused.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Richmond\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Haverford College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{Haverford College students have full cross registration with Bryn Maur College across the street, and can swim in the pool at Bryn Mawr College, a woman\u2019s college.

You really have to be happy with your nose in a book all the time.  Stanford, on the other hand, is a little less classically egghead.  The students are all extremely talented but the overall vibe of the place is mellower and the pace is a bit slower.

In terms of culture, Amherst did have underground fraternities which have recently been banned, so Amherst is no stranger to the party scene. Amherst has worked hard to foster economic diversity.  Both have excellent soccer, at least on the Men\u2019s side, which is what I\u2019m familiar with. Dartmouth does have a Women\u2019s Club team which \u2013 at the D1 level \u2013 is usually a very competitive program.  Amherst would have more of an intramural program.

So why not, here is my take on your questions and issues:\n\n\nFees: In general education in Canada is usually much less expensive than in the US. This can differ in specific cases but apparently this is your experience also. Getting more financial aid in the US but having it still cost more is perfectly normal.\n\n\nReputation- McGill has a very strong worldwide reputation. Mount Holyoke is a good school.\n\n\nMasters (MA/MBA) prospects- This probably depends more on your grades that anything else. See 11 below\u2026 However, McGill does have a wide range of Master\u2019s and Doctorate programs.\n\n\nJob Prospects- Depends widely on what you study, how you do, and where you want to work. You mentioned that you have never been to Canada nor to the US. If you are not a US citizen nor permanent resident, then getting a visa to work in the US after graduation is unlikely. If you get a 3 or 4 year degree from McGill, this entitles you to get a 3 year work visa for Canada (but not for the US).\n\n\nInternship opportunities- Mount Holyoke is sort of in the middle of nowhere, which makes me wonder what would be around (there are a couple of nice small towns nearby, but not much in the way of large businesses). McGill is in the center of a large city, and quite near the business center of the city. I am not sure about visa requirements in either case.\n\n\nCourses offered- Obviously McGill is very good at a very wide range of subjects. I am not sure about taking classes between faculties there. I have heard that McGill students can also take occasional courses at Concordia (a slightly larger nearby university, the only other English university in Montreal), but I don\u2019t know details.\n\n\nAdjusting-? I\u2019m an international student who has been struggling with some mental health issues. Too much socializing scares me, but I can definitely strike up a convo/get to know people.\n\n\nMcGill is a large university which tends to treat you as an \u201cadult\u201d, which means that support is minimal and you have to go looking for it. If you are not doing well and you don\u2019t ask for help, they no one is going to come find you. Mount Holyoke is a very different environment but I don\u2019t know as much about this.\n\nExtra Curriculars- ? No sports. Singing, dancing, debating, volunteer work, etc\n\nI am not sure that I understand your comment. McGill has sports, singing, small music events almost every night (for example, students in their excellent music school give concerts), and pretty much anything else that you would want to look for. I recall on our last visit an informal hockey game being played on an outdoor rink on the campus (I am pretty sure that the rink disappears and becomes lawn in the spring). You don\u2019t have to partake in any of it if you don\u2019t want to.\nI might note that the drinking age in Montreal is 18. Some allege this makes drinking on campus less bothersome, because it brings the drinking students out of their dorms and into the bars, where they are less willing to embarrass themselves and also where they are less annoying to anyone who didn\u2019t walk into the same bar. Drinking age in Massachusetts is 21.\n\n\nWeather- Montreal winters are fine most of the time, but there will be a few very cold snaps. When you are out of the wind it should be ok. Mount Holyoke will also have \u201creal\u201d winters, but not quite as cold. My wild guess is that there might actually be very slightly more snow in Mount Holyoke, but there will be plenty of snow in either location.\n\n\nHousing- I would love to stay in an apartment (which I will have to do from McGill 2nd yr) but i don\u2019t know if it takes up too much study time.\n\n\nThere are a lot of apartments very close to McGill, and a lot more one or two or three subway stops away. The McGill students seem to do fine with it. Housing in Montreal is relatively moderate in price. I might add that the crime rate will be very low at either school.\n\nI want to do well academically.\n\nHere is a big difference. McGill will be VERY challenging academically. The top universities in Canada, particularly McGill and Toronto, compared to top universities in the US are easier to get into but once there harder to graduate from. You will need to work very hard there, and put in very long hours. If you are very smart and work very hard then you can learn an enormous amount at McGill from professors who really know their stuff. But, this is important: YOU HAVE TO WANT TO DO IT. It is very hard to get an A at McGill.\nIn comparison, Mount Holyoke will not be as academically challenging. It will still be academically very good but it will be easier to get an A (or all A\u2019s).\nOne question: Which will make it easier to go to graduate school? It is hard to say. If you get straight A\u2019s at McGill, then this will be impressive even to the top graduate schools in the US and elsewhere. However, this will be very difficult (or impossible) to do. For most people, getting A\u2019s at Mount Holyoke will probably be so much easier that they will get into graduate school more easily than they would have at McGill.\n\u201cI can only read and write french as of now.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t need any French at all to go to McGill. If you learn to speak a little bit (un petit peu) of French this will enhance your experience living in Montreal.\n\u201cThis is probably the weirdest question\u201d\nThis is indeed an Apples versus Watermelons sort of comparison. But I can see why it is not an easy choice to make.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{@PurpleTitan couldn\u2019t agree more\nI will mention again and for  @CU123\nUSC has produced the 4th most billionaires of any US university   I don\u2019t think Stanford or Harvard would have been worth it for them.

Other than weather and your perception of your fit with the coach and team, I think the biggest difference is that, in contrast to Stanford\u2019s special academic hand holding of its athletes, Princeton tries to treat its student/athletes as students first and athletes second.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Brown University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{@ciervo\nAll those reasons (the super lenient drop deadline, amount of pass/fail coursework allowed, no grade lower than a C showing up on your transcript, high percentage of As for classes, etc.) are exactly why I said that grade inflation exists at Brown.

I\u2019m sorry; but you are only deluding yourself if you\u2019re thinking Duke = Harvard.\nFor school prestige and brand name recognition, Berkeley is much more closer to Harvard than Duke is to Harvard. Perhaps some students may be choosing private schools over Berkeley because they prefer the system \u2013 how almost everything is being handed out to them rather than them making an effort to get those same things. But that doesn\u2019t have any bearing to school prestige, particularly in this case, and specially for engineering. The data I showed are full-proofs and true testaments to my arguments.\nDuke may be able to offer a more caring environment with the kind of personal attention it gives to its students, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s automatically more prestigious. If we have to go by that logic, then it would appear all the LACs are more prestigious than Duke. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any LAC out there I can honestly consider to be more prestigious than Duke. So, that logic fails.\nFor many, many aspiring engineers, yes, they would rather have Berkeley (than Duke) behind their names.

Undergrad has nothing to do with compensation.\nIn the situation above, where the recent graduate got the $70K per year job: I assume her alternate path would be a lesser paying job, say $40,000 just for discussion. Say both jobs are in California. the 70K job will take home about 52K after federal, state, social sec, medicare, etc. The 40K job will take home will take home about 33K for a difference of 19K per year.\nKeeping the arithmetic simple 240K divided by 20K is a 12 year payback. But the arithmetic is not that simple. If the 240K were invested it would likely double resulting in a payback of 24 years. And that assumes that a 22 year old would start saving 100% of the difference between the two jobs, the likelihood of which is about zero. So the real time to pay back easily exceeds a quarter century for most people.\nI am not arguing that making more money is pointless. However, giving up savings and compounding investment returns in exchange for a system of progressive taxation a questionable choice. The same is true on the other end of the workalike calendar. If you are nearing retirement, would you rather have saved more than enough or hope that your final years are the highest paying and maybe you can save the difference realizing that is precisely when companies will wonder about younger, less expensive replacements? I would pick savings.\nA hard to calculate factor is that compensation arc. For the physician, the slope of the arc is zero. It just doesn\u2019t matter where a person did undergrad. For many other jobs, the Ivy league graduate might have an accelerated compensation arc over a career, mitigating the time for payback of the more expensive education.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pomona College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{Any reason you\u2019re not considering going to U of T or Waterloo?

It is ok to turn down Stanford, there are plenty of athletes that choose other schools for various reasons that are important to them. It is your life. Just be sure you are doing so based on significant reasons that are important to you. If your gut is not clearly ringing a loud bell then write down what is really important or matters in your choice - academics, athletic prestige, academic prestige, importance of winning, importance of winning level (NCAA Champion potential), coaches, team mates, location, family support nearby, big budget program, weather, size of school, support of athletes - anything at all that matters. Then prioritize them for you. Put the winner in one column and see which school has the most \u201cvictories.\u201d Sometimes it is good to separate out factors that are all jumbled in your head and causing confusion. It can help you see what is important to you.\nAnd as a last thought, I always suggest students ask themselves this question\u202610 years from now, where do you want to say you graduated from?\nI assume you have until the November 8th-15th NLI period, which means someone has to be readying the paperwork now/very soon, so perhaps you have made your decision?

And as far as USN&WR is concerned, acceptance rate is only a minor factor in determining selectivity. They evaluate selectivity using the following factors:\n65% weight - SAT or ACT scores for enrolled (not admitted) students\n25% weight - fraction of enrolled (not admitted) students in top 10% of their high school class\n10% weight - acceptance rate\nIn other words, \u201cselectivity\u201d is not really determined by the number of students that a school turns away. Instead, it\u2019s mostly determined by the quality of the students that a school attracts.\nIn the 2018 ranking, BC was ranked #28 for selectivity specifically, while BU was ranked #45. Note that these are just the ranks for selectivity, which is only one component of the overall ranking. BU ranked higher than BC in other components, like \u201cfaculty resources\u201d, and so the overall rankings were closer.\nSo there is a good case that BC is the more \u201cselective\u201d school.

What dilemma? Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale\u2019s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being \u201cinexpensive\u201d for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend.\nIn the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers).\nMany scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Chicago\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{Palo Alto is expensive no doubt.

However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down.\u201d\nMuch2learn, the range of Michigan students enrolled in the CoE is similar to the students enrolled at Cornell or Penn. There is no difference in the quality of the students. There may have been a slight difference in quality in the 90s and 00s, but the gap has closed entirely in recent years.\nThere are simple reasons for the small gap in starting pay.\nFirst of all, Cornell\u2019s data is for 2017, while Penn and Michigan\u2019s reports are for 2016 graduates. That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay.\nSecond, the makeup of the students in the engineering programs. For example, at Michigan, most engineering students (over 70%) major in Aerospace, Civil, Chemical, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical etc\u2026Those aren\u2019t the highest paid Engineering disciplines. At Penn, roughly 50% major in CS, CE-related majors, which pay significantly more. In this regard, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of majors than Penn, which seems to lean heavily on CS/CE majors.\nBut even then, the advantage when it comes to placing graduates in companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft clearly favors Michigan, even over the likes of Cornell:\nMichigan: 149\nPenn: 39\nCornell: 38\nMichigan is obviously twice larger than Cornell and three times larger than Penn (although Penn has roughly almost as many CS/CE majors as Michigan), but advantage in the number placed in those tippy top Tech firms clearly favors Michigan.\nThird, while many CS majors end up in Silicon Valley, the majority, certainly over 50%, will work regionally. For example, according to Penn\u2019s report, close to 60% of Penn graduates took jobs in the Mid Atlantic (DC to NYC) and Northeast (mostly Boston). In the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly  lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living. Since 50%-60% of the graduates work and live regionally, it stands to reason that those take jobs in the most expensive region will have higher starting salaries.  That can easily account for the 15% gap between Michigan (and other Midwestern schools like Northwestern and UIUC) and East Coast universities (like Cornell and Penn).\nBelow are the average starting salaries Engineering/CS graduates:\nCornell: $79,000\nMichigan: $76,000\nNorthwestern: $70,000\nPenn: $88,000\nhttps://issuu.com/nucareeradvance/docs/beyond_northwestern_handout_2016_fi\nhttp://www.engineering.cornell.edu/resources/career_services/students/statistics/upload/Undergraduate-Class-of-2016.pdf\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{@Purpletitan Based on what I know, I would choose Michigan. I think that 4 years is a long time and that school that is the best social fit is probably the best fit.\nI also think that Michigan will be less demanding than MIT, but that may be good, because it can afford the OP with more time to get involved in research, being a TA, participating in coding clubs, adding a minor in math or stats, prepping for interviews, and other valuable bells and whistles.\nHowever, each student is different. For example, if the OP is planning a CS major, top CS students are being offered compensation of over $200k/year directly out of college. In that case, $250k in education costs is a lot, but it is not insurmountable if the student believes that they will thrive better in the MIT environment.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Vassar College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Kenyon College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{\n\n\n Publisher:\n[quote]\nWe are discussing this because of the publicity . . .\n[/quote]\n\nHave you looked at the schools that appear in the link in reply #47?

With the med school admissions move to competency based admissions, more weight are going to be put on activities outside classroom. If the student is \u201con the bubble\u201d academically, less time for that student can be put on activities outside classroom. Not to mention the possible anxiety which might come with that uncertainty.\nPersonally I think \u201cjust build confidence as a freshman by taking it easy\u201d is a huge mistake. Students should take a mix of difficult and not-so-difficult courses to test the water. Sooner or later those \u201cdifficult\u201d courses are going to come. It is better to know if it is feasible to achieve the above-the-threshold GPA as soon as possible. \u201cOn the bubble\u201d is the worst scenario.  Adding a more difficult major like computer science/etc.as a backup probably makes things worse. If the student can\u2019t even handle the premed courses without other hard/time-consuming courses, what are the chances that the students would be able to handle both? Plus different majors have totally different internships.\nThere is no one-size-fit-all answer to OP\u2019s question. OP is smart enough to think about this. I agree with @Creekland 's statement 100% \u201cWhen kids from my school are hoping to go to med school and ask for my advice it\u2019s simple. Look for an affordable school you like where you\u2019re in the Top 25% of entering stats\u201d. It is not good to play tennis in a league full of people like Novak Djokovic if one can\u2019t play tennis at that level.\nOP should view the course material as its competitor, not its classmates. Yes, at this level, the material is much more advanced. We have reviewed and written some solutions for Orgo exams recently. It is definitely not easy. A high level of understanding of the material is required to answer the questions correctly. (We actually get 2.5 points since we found out TA graded one question wrong \u2014 this is the joke \u2026 we gained 2.5 points but we weren\u2019t even there.  ) OP should strive to learn the material at a high level in a school at this level.

Although Duke is located in the South, most of the kids come from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, California and Florida.  Duke does not feel like a Southern school and even though it\u2019s not located in a major city, there is constantly a lot going on with incredible speakers from all over the world and all sorts of research opportunities.  After taking the college tour, my D\u2019s comment was \u201cmom, there is so much going on there, it feels like they are throwing opportunities at you.\u201d  FWIW, Melinda Gates went to Duke and has donated a lot of money there.  Duke is constantly is reaching out to its Alumni to create internships and all sorts of learning opportunities for its students.  Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley.\nI think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn\u2019t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates.\nBut these were our impressions. Hopefully others can give you theirs too so you can get a better feel about if there\u2019s a consistent theme.   Good luck, and you really can\u2019t go wrong.

The reputation of Hopkins being brutal for pre-med has for some reason persisted. Maybe it is not true as you say,  but I a far from the only one with this perception. Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful.\nCornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application.\nAs for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent. There is not a big actual different but Cornell and Dartmouth probably benefit because they are ivies.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{Take money out of the equation for a second.

He is in the 3-2 engineering program and  loves it. Unlike the typical 3-2 where you leave the liberal arts college at the end of the 3rd year, for the Dartmouth plan the student studies at their LAC for freshman and sophomore year, then move on to Dartmouth for their junior year, when most of their friends are studying abroad. For their senior year they go back to their LAC, graduate with their friends and get their BA degree, and return back to Dartmouth for a 5th year and get their BE degree in an engineering discipline.\nWhat is nice about this program is that the student gets an excellent STEM education at the LAC with very small class sizes where they get to really know their professors and do research as an undergraduate. At Thayer (Dartmouth\u2019s Engineering School) you get a very project oriented engineering education with a strong entrepreneurial focus. Dartmouth is on a quarter system so many professors have their own engineering / tech companies they are running, bringing current real-world challenges to class.  Also, there is a certain camaraderie amongst all the 3-2 students from the various LAC\u2019s.\nTypically if you maintain a 3.5 or better at your LAC and take Calc I, II, III, Physics I, II, Chem, and CS, you get into Dartmouth. If I am not mistaken they get about 100 applicants a year, with about 40 or so getting accepted into the program each year.\nThere is no question that the 3-2 plan will require an extra year of education and the costs that go with that. However, that additional year provides you the ability to take the extensive math and science prereqs for an engineering degree, but also affords you the ability to take more humanities and social science courses. The part of the education you get at a LAC will be more discussion based (as opposed to a lecture based model), enabling you to become a more effective communicator and develop critical thinking skills. This is an investment that will make you a more marketable candidate with employers.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Vanderbilt University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Northwestern University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{@waitingmomla \n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bates College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{@hopeful1660: If you are asking me in more than a rhetorical way, I\u2019d say that Yes the difference between a 25th percentile ACT score of 28 (Bates) and a one of 31 (Hamilton) might effect the classroom experiences at these schools.\nhttp://www.compassprep.com/college-profiles-new-sat/\nHowever, my intent was not to emphasize standardized testing, but rather to simply point it out as one of the differences between your choices.

There\u2019s another kind of gap year at Olin. Waitlisted students are told they might get in for the coming fall semester but, if not, they are guaranteed admission the following fall - after a full academic year. This is still called a \u201cgap year\u201d but it\u2019s clearly different. I don\u2019t think Olin is worried about losing these students to other colleges. They wish them the best. If some of them end up at another school, well, Olin has many other students available to fill a freshman class.  My waitlisted son knew he wanted to attend Olin. During his gap year he took manufacturing technology courses at a local community college and brushed up on math and Spanish at a local 4-year school.  The community college courses especially helped him realize he\u2019s more passionate about mechanical engineering than computer science and software engineering. He also worked and lived at home. Not what he or we would have chosen but, looking back, an ideal year in his and our lives. It would have been less-ideal without taking those classes.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{This seems right to me.

I have no doubt that the best Michigan students can compete with anyone and can command salaries in the $110k - $150k range. However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down. To me it appears that there is just not enough information to tell why the Michigan average is lower. Maybe you have some insight?\nI didn\u2019t see a huge difference in CS (90K for UM, 100K for Penn?) which is the major we\u2019re discussing.  So lot will depend on the respondents as well, Cornell only had 114 respondents (119 responded but five didn\u2019t answer a lot of the questions it looked like) so that\u2019s not a huge response rate.  Maybe those that didn\u2019t have great salaries decided not to report.  Also you\u2019re assuming that everyone is honest in these things.\nSecond, you have stock options that will lower the starting salary in companies, esp in tech.  Grads will take a lower salary if it means 500 Google stock vesting over 4 years.  Also Google I believe sets salary on how well you do in your interview, so once you get an interview, if you\u2019re a SJSU grad (and there are a lot of those at Google and Apple), you can do better wrt compensation than an ivy leaguer if you have a superb interview.\nAnd you\u2019re comparing Michigan to Cornell and Penn, who have better engineering and comp sci programs than Columbia.  That\u2019s not as straightforward a comparison as UM and Columbia, where UM has the clear edge.  Cornell and Penn have the two best engr/cs programs in the ivies and would be in the second set of schools I mentioned.

Ann Arbor is larger so not part of that particular comparison.\nI\u2019ve visited Ann Arbor a few times recently. And will be going there a few more times yet.\nAnn Arbor\u2019s downtown is bigger than Ithaca\u2019s. and it is easier to walk to, because there is no huge hill separating it from the campus. To me it feels more suburban, whereas Ithaca is more hippy-ish. Ann Arbor is very convenient to the Detroit suburbs, if you live there. And to Detroit. I imagine students do get some value from Detroit, but to me large swathes of it look to be in shambles. Literally.\nIthaca is surrounded by fantastic state parks, and has a very \u201cchill\u201d vibe to it that is hard to match, IMO. The campus is also beautiful. I personally love it there. I take vacations there. Nearly every year. It is clearly more isolated, but most students find there is enough to do right there, most of the time. To get the most out of your time there, it is best to have a car during the upperclassman years. Or have a friend who has a car. That is not required, but it enables one to more fully experience Ithaca and the surrounding areas far from the campus. If you want to get away for a weekend,there are daily buses from campus to NYC, and boatloads of students who are from the area traveling in the vicinity all the time. But NYC is 4+ hours away.\nThe person I am visiting in Ann Arbor wanted met o go to a football game. Because it is such a big deal there. The irony is that this person hates sports and wouldn\u2019t apply to Cornell because it had too much sports.\nThere are certainly people at Cornell who go to all the football games. And, at least when I was there, were rabid about hockey. However a lot of people who attend Cornell would feel that this amount of obsession about sports is frankly retarded.So perhaps that\u2019s a point of campus culture distinction.\nIt\u2019s true that Cornell has a large alumni presence in and around NYC. The alumni club there is particularly active. Much moreso than those of our other alma maters. I\u2019ve attended a number of interesting lectures they\u2019ve sponsored.\nI\u2019m far removed from Wall Street by now, but at least based on my framework in antiquity I would agree with @blevine\u2019s description. Except that, from what I saw, those quant jobs did not often go to people out of undergrad. Heck, the trading firm I worked for hired physics PhDs for those jobs. There\u2019s a lot of money involved they weren\u2019t messing around. Most of the undergrad hires I saw were  liberal arts majors from top schools.( Including Brown, BTW. Cornell too.)  And grads of business programs such as Wharton, NYU  and Ross. And also Cornell, even though at that time AEM was \u201cAg Ec\u201d and didn\u2019t have the reputation it has now.\nEither way, to get a Wall Street job, in my day at least one would need to be exceptional. And \u201cfit\u201d. I suggest do not make your whole decision based on that. Besides after a year you might get turned on by psychology, or whatever, and completely change your objectives.\nThe new tech center in NYC is for grad programs. It is still in its infancy but I would not bank on it doing much for you, if I were you.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Virginia\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{My D is also deciding between Umich and UVa.

Former Carl parent here. A few thoughts \u2026\nWork study \u2026 You indicated that they find jobs for the kids. I don\u2019t remember that being the case for ds, especially after his first year. As a freshman, he worked in the dining hall, but I think that\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t aggressive in finding his own gig. Subsequent years, he found jobs that were more suited to his interests, though I will say that he loved even working in the dining hall. lol One thing I loved is how kids get paid. They can either take all the money, have their whole check credited to their student account or split it 50-50. I assumed every school did this, but that wasn\u2019t the case at ds2\u2019s university; as a result, I think the cash got squandered. Not so for ds1 \u2013 he had all his check rolled over into his account and was such a diligent worker that he got a fat refund when he graduated!\nHe did study abroad junior year in a non-Carleton program. In addition to the Carleton-led options, there are scores of other options thanks to the consortiums to which Carleton belongs. Every year, there\u2019s a big study-abroad fair where kids can check out their choices, and that\u2019s how ds found his program \u2013  a semester in New Zealand. He absolutely loved it, including meeting kids from other colleges. Every year on his birthday, the first person on FB to post a msg is his host mom from Auckland. It\u2019s so fun to get that yearly reminder of his wonderful time there. The FA office was wonderful. Everything went really smoothly. He handled the whole thing, and it just couldn\u2019t have gone better.\nAbout ultimate \u2026 well, it\u2019s a thing at Carleton. If he doesn\u2019t want to play super-competitively, there\u2019s the Hot Karls, the developmental team. And, of course, the DIII team and the DI team. Just knowing that he played ultimate in HS makes me think that he belongs at Carleton!  Yes, Amherst has a team, too. But I\u2019m unabashedly biased.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pomona College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{Mudd recently put some limits on CS electives due to the overwhelming number of non-Mudd students taking CS classes at Mudd.

She had a range from no aid to very good merit. We really, really struggled with the decision, but it came down to Cornell, ranked #11 for engineering, and VT, ranked #14.\nCornell was too expensive for us, and the other schools just didn\u2019t measure up. She cried for 24 hours, then she was over it.\nShe is finishing up her freshman year. She made Deans list last semester (no worries about getting her first choice major) She lives in the engineering housing (Lee Hall, Hypatia  for women, Galileo for men) which has probably made a difference- everyone is taking the same classes and so they all have to study at the same times, no pressure to party when you should study.\nMy favorite part? Everyone seems so happy to be there. When we were wandering around campus trying to come to terms with turning down \u201can Ivy\u201d , kids would literally just start talking to us. \u201cWould your daughter like to see my dorm room? I live in Lee Hall\u201d or telling us about their plans for graduate school, how their classes went, what they thought about work-life balance. Literally random girls we met while petting their dogs. Tons of cute dogs.\nThe parents we met at restaurants were nice, and many were alums. They showed us photos of their kids, they asked us to let them know what she decided. Every single person we met was so great. There were NINE rainbows on our drive home. It was just so great. It IS so great.\nMy friend is a CEO of a tech company in the research triangle. She says \u201csome of the best engineers I hire are VT grads\u201d\nI\u2019m sorry, I am a little biased, but, really, it\u2019s the whole package. Rutgers is basically a commuter campus.

Besides, who knows what your son will become interested in once he starts college? In this comparison, I think the academics are generally comparable. However, your son may prefer the open curriculum of Amherst to the breadth requirements of Carleton (or vice versa). I would caution you on comparing specific professors. You\u2019ll find great professors at both schools.\nThen there is the question of three classes per trimester (Carleton) vs. four classes per semester (Amherst). This can make a huge difference, depending on your son\u2019s learning style. As an example, since my firstborn is a champion of procrastination and last-minute cramming, like her father, the trimester system is excellent. She is used to the fast pace given her background in taking classes at the community college (quarter system), and the ten-week schedule will give her no time to slack off. On the other hand, a friend of ours with a chemistry degree from Berkeley looked at the syllabus of the intro chemistry class and said, \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s a lot to absorb in such a short period of time.\u201d The semester system gives you more time to let concepts sink in. What does your son prefer? Is he disciplined about staying on top of his work and pacing himself?\nRegarding @juillet 's point about facilities, I can tell you firsthand that Carleton\u2019s science facilities are better than Amherst\u2019s, and further improvements are in the works. Then again, someone mentioned that Amherst also has improvement projects planned, so during your son\u2019s time in college, this may become a wash.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{If her father isn\u2019t willing to pay then he gets no say.\nIf he doesn\u2019t pay, can you afford Cornell out of income and savings?\n(DO NOT take on parents loans for Cornell just because dad is pushing for it!)\nIf you can afford Cornell: has she visited?

They each have their pluses and minuses.\nAs awesome as JHU is, it has a rep of being a grind for premeds.  JHU for med or residency.  Not so great for undergrads.\nYale is tough on premeds as well.  I\u2019ve told this story before.  When my son was a college freshman premed I ran into an old friend whose son was a freshman premed at Yale.  Her son was determined to go to med school and they were confident Yale would pave the way. The friend was aghast that my son was attending a mid-tier flagship and she voiced a lot of doubt about whether he\u2019d get into a med school.  Fast forward a few years, her son\u2019s GPA was not med-school worthy.  My son will be graduating from med school in May.\nDon\u2019t believe the hype about Yale inflation and that everyone gets A\u2019s in their classes.  Maybe it\u2019s that way for other paths, but the premed prereqs are still weeder classes at Yale.  Like every other college in the nation, they must reduce the number of their premeds.\nAs for UPitt @ucbalumnus is exactly right.  College is much harder than high school when in a serious major.  Adding premed path into the mix makes things even more difficult.  I have two premed parent forums and every fall parents are posting that their child-who\u2019s-never-received-a-B-in-his-life is now struggling to bring his mid-semester C average in Gen Chem or Bio up to please-be-at-least-a-B.  These are kids who took the most rigorous high school schedules, took the zero period class, and were top 1-5% of their class.\nI\u2019m a little shocked that the 3.75 GPA req\u2019t is \u201cper semester\u201d and not evaluated at the end of the year.  Bio, chem, and physics classes are usually 4-5 credits per class and a B in one of them can sink a semester\u2019s BCPM GPA even if the student gets A\u2019s in the other BCPM courses he takes that semester.\nConsidering that the Pitt program only takes the cream of the high school crop (poaching from Ivys), and 50% don\u2019t make it thru, there\u2019s reason to be concerned.\nOf course a Pitt student who gets booted from the program can still proceed as a premed, get GPA where it needs to be and apply to other med schools later.  BUT\u2026the $20k per year EFC may be an issue to the family.  Is it?\n\n[QUOTE=\"\"\"\"]\n[quote]\n[quote]\n...may still get into a decent med school down the road.\n[/quote]\n[/quote]\n[/QUOTE]\n\nLol\u2026I can\u2019t let that sentence pass.  We don\u2019t have any \u201cdecent\u201d med schools in the US.  All of our med schools are excellent.  There are about 145 med schools in the USA.  They all teach the same things; the education is flat. Any premed should be thrilled to get into any of them.  No one is too good for any of them.\nMy vote is for Yale. Cost-wise it\u2019s better.  The Yale name will help if his career path changes.  Just remind him NOT to believe the Yale-hype about 90% of students get A\u2019s.  That doesn\u2019t apply to premed prereqs.  He\u2019ll have to be self-disciplined.  Freshman have so many distractions and it\u2019s their first time away from mom and dad.\nIf he gets at least a 3.7 GPA at Yale and scores well on the MCAT (sounds like he\u2019s a strong test taker anyway), and has medically related ECs and some research experiences, he\u2019ll likely get into a med school.  As a Calif resident, he\u2019ll need to apply broadly and include some Midwest privates since getting into a Calif med school is crazy difficult.\n\n[QUOTE=\"\"\"\"]\n[quote]\n[quote]\nHis ultimate goal is going medicine. Going with the Pitt's GAP is obviously the way to achieve his goal in one-step shot in a top-10 med school, however, he is looking at about 20k/yr for four under graduate years (he's awarded 20k scholarship but we have to pay the out-state tuition since we are from California), vs Yale offered a total package with only 5k EFC. The other thing bothers my son is that for the GAP you have to maintain a 3.75 for each semester (both overall and BCPM), which means if you miss one, you will be out from the guaranteed medical school admission and end up with a Pitt undergrad education for roughly a cost of 80k in four years, where with Yale you will earn a Ivy undergra education with far less cost and may still get to a decent med school down to the road.\n[quote]\n[/quote]\n[/quote]\n[/quote]\n[/QUOTE]\n\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{enjoy!\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of North Carolina\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{UNC\u2013no guaranteed admit to business\nUSC- On the eest coast\u2013you are interested in working on the East Coast\nBC\u2013On the east coast.

We live in Ohio and most of the students at her high school chose to attend OSU, OhioU, Miami U or Dayton. The drinking/party culture at those schools did not appeal to her and she was looking for a very different college experience. Vasser, Grinnell, Carleton were all on her list\u2014 she was looking for many of the same things the OP noted. I will tell you so far, she has nothing but excellent things to say about Kenyon\u2014 she absolutely loves it. She says there are plenty of things to do on the weekend besides go to parties\u2026 often times so many different things that she has to choose one over the other when she\u2019d like to do both. And in addition, my introverted kid says she actually enjoys going to the parties on campus\u2026 they are fun, \u201cpeople actually dance\u201d lol her words, and sometimes she chooses to have a beer and other times not. No one cares either way. She\u2019s an athlete and enjoys hanging out with the team, but also has other friends she goes out with as well. She is busy all the time\u2026 I wish she\u2019d call more! We are extremely close so it\u2019s an adjustment not hearing from her every day but I am so thankful she is loving Kenyon as much as she is and is not homesick (yet at least!) I know it\u2019s still early, but I honestly didn\u2019t think the adjustment to college would be so smooth. She says it is an incredibly supportive community and the people there are very down to earth, interesting and like minded when it comes to being serious about genuinely learning new things etc.\nInterestingly enough tonight when I called she had just come from a mandatory meeting at her dorm (bi monthly I believe) called beer and sex LOL where they talk about drinking responsibly on campus etc. So it seems the administration is not blind to what from my perspective seems like \u201caverage\u201d college drinking\u2026 but then I\u2019m comparing it to what I know about schools like Dayton and OU\u2026 where drinking is pretty much the only weekend activity available. Just the perspective of one student\u2026 but this was a thread I would have stalked like a hawk a year ago when we were looking, and I am so glad she made the decision to attend Kenyon\u2014 So much so my middle child is considering it after seeing how happy her big sis is.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{@CU123, and I repeat again: They Are Among The Top 10 Feeders to PhD programs even without \u201ctippy-top candidates\u201d.\nYou seem to be one of those guys who measures how successful college football programs are solely by how they do in recruiting rankings rather than, you know, actual wins and losses on the field.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: New York University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{@preppedparent:  That\u2019s nice.

Emory labeled 13 schools as peers (Brown, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, U of Chicago, U of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, Washington U, and Yale). Only 3 of those schools also listed Emory as a peer institution (Northwestern, Vanderbilt, and Washington U).  All 3 of those schools also list Rochester U as a peer institution (along with all having a higher ranking than Emory by US News and World Report ratings) so Rochester is held in very high esteem (even with a ranking of 33 in the same US News and World Report rankings).  I only know of one student who chose between Emory and Rochester and they chose Rochester, graduated and is currently a 2nd year in Dental School.

I actually look at the course materials and still don\u2019t think I can get a truly representative depiction of how academics would \u201cfeel\u201d at two schools.  Take for example the comparisons I did back in the day with chemistry and biology courses.  I have found that even in cases where professors at X school for X course where generally different/more challenging in terms of content and testing style than professors at Y school for X course, that often the students at Y claim that their course is still very challenging even in cases where the student body qualities were similar or Y was higher AND both schools had similar grading practices in STEM, which means that even my approach using raw course materials has limitations.  I for example cannot account for whether or not student/intellectual (I do not conflate this with incoming stats.  Institutions with similar or different stats can have vastly different intellectual vibes and tendencies with respect to how students pursue academics and even what majors they tend to pursue) culture is different at each and maybe one school receives a certain type of course differently than those at another or if the instructor teaching the \u201charder\u201d course used more effective methods to encourage student success at one school, so thus students at the school with the \u201charder\u201d course complain less about it.\nTo ask us to compare two schools of high caliber based upon \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d and hearsay has even more limitations.  I need people to stop asking about this.  It is too messy.  It would honestly just be better if they researched to perhaps stumble upon some course materials at whatever schools so that they can at least gauge where they stand versus the level of cognitive demands by professors in whatever department at each.  And then after that, you just cross your fingers for effective teaching if the material is found to be more difficult than expected.  Either way, I think so many ask the wrong questions and go about finding answers in a misguided way. The best I could do for these folks is give them links to course materials and maybe commenting on them or describing the courses I know about from my school if material from the other is unavailable.  But anyone saying: \u201cOh this school definitely is harder and has more weedouts\u201d is usually making a baseless assumption not even supported by grade data or any course materials.  I see so many myths spread based upon \u201cgut feeling\u201d and hearsay such as X, Y, and Z have worse grade deflation versus A, B, and C, and then data tells a completely different story or exposes the first group as hyperbolic or unaware.\n@mom2collegekids :  I was being sarcastic.  That is basically what I was saying.  This poster has asked this question in every single thread they posted on comparison of schools and otherwise.  So I was getting annoyed.\n@Jugulator20 :  It is tough, but usually only intro. classes have grade distributions like that. As courses become less exam based, the distribution usually shifts to a more rightward skew.  I don\u2019t like looking at grading distributions of only the As anyway, because to be honest, most successful pre-meds can afford  a couple of B grades here and there, and there are usually plenty of opportunities to boost the STEM GPA while also learning at a high level to balance out those \u201cpotential B courses\u201d.  The fact is, privates and elite publics are often very generous with the B range grades.  Admittedly courses like gen. physics and chemistry may give out a decent chunk of Cs which could be dangerous, but there is some room for error in these challenging environments, especially in courses with low test averages where the grades get re-centered using a curve.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Wesleyan University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{I agree that your choice of college will depend on how sure you are with respect to your intended major.

Many students choose not to partake at lots of schools but, like the \u201chow to avoid lax bro culture\u201d in another thread, for students who are looking to avoid a dominant scene, it is helpful to really talk to a lot of students and possibly spend time on campus on a Wed (usually a big party night) or weekend night and see for themselves. Even then, it is hard to put in perspective \u2013 my non-drinking high school senior was shocked by the party scene at some schools, but now partakes, usually in moderation, I think. So what a 17-18 year old thinks may change.\nI was one of the parents who described our experience with Vassar and Kenyon. Kenyon is a wonderful school, wonderful faculty, engaged students. It was the first school each of my kids visited and their first choice early in the process. Eventually, it came off the list, with size and location being part of that decision.  But what was right for them is not a predictor for anyone else. My perception of the student body from visits plus knowing several recent grads and current students, is that there is a sophistication about many of the students that feels \u201curban/east coast.\u201d I would contrast that with, say, Grinnell, which is also a wonderful school with wonderful faculty and engaged students, but feels more \u201cmidwest nice\u201d than \u201ceast coast cool.\u201d Of course, there are students who don\u2019t fit that description at either school. Your mileage may vary.\nFor folks who know, I have been genuinely curious about how the Kenyon greek life housing clusters feels to non-greek life students and whether the chapter houses can be used for parties or not.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Boston College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgetown University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{\u2013 BC has a stronger conservative/catholic tradition than Georgetown, which is pretty liberal despite being Jesuit\n\u2013 Georgetown is known for having a wealthier student body than BC\n\u2013 BC Hockey, Georgetown basketball (not the greatest but there\u2019s a lot of history and tradition in their program)\n\u2013 Suburban vibe at BC vs more of an urban vibe at Georgetown\n\u2013 Georgetown has a competitive nature (getting into clubs etc.) BC not so much (but this can be a pro or a con because some people thrive in a competitive environment.\n\u2013 OF COURSE, it doesn\u2019t really need to be said that Georgetown is more highly ranked and prestigious than BC.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Rochester\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Emory University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{This is probably the silliest arguemet I\u2019ve seen on here.

For these two schools, I get:\nCarleton: 40.2 % STEM, 12.1 % physical sciences specifically\nAmherst: 26.6 % STEM, 5.1 % physical sciences specifically\nSo there does appear to be more interest in STEM, and in physical sciences particularly, at Carleton. There is some suspicion that \u201copen curriculum\u201d schools (such as Amherst) attract a disproportionate number of science/math-phobes (because they can avoid taking any classes in these fields). In recent years, there has some concern about the aging of the Amherst science facilities, but a brand new science center is under construction, and is scheduled to open in Fall 2018.\nI\u2019m sure you can get a great undergraduate physics education at Amherst. However, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there are more physics faculty and a broader variety of physics courses at Carleton. You could review the college catalogs to see. Note, however, that Amherst students also have access to the 5-College Consortium, which could increase the range of physics course options, most likely at UMass.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Pittsburgh\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{I hope you filed the FAFSA and PHEAA grant form if you are a PA student.

We could be nitpicking league tables just to win in an argument, when in fact, there is very little that separates between them, unlike in engineering where Berkeley is considered part of the \u201choly trinity\u201d, standing alongside MIT and Stanford. And, for the record, I did not present those rankings to tell anyone on here that Berkeley is superior to Duke for banking/finance, but to disprove anyone who claims Berkeley would be a terrible training ground and feeder school to banking/finance.\nI agree Duke is a fantastic school, as a whole. In the same way that I agree Yale, for instance, is an amazing school, in general. But those schools have weaknesses and engineering happens to be the worst of them. Coincidentally, engineering happens to be Berkeley\u2019s one of its strongest departments, and Berkeley \u2013 its name \u2013 is highly reputable, not only in America but throughout the whole universe. Duke, though good as a whole, doesn\u2019t enjoy such grandiose reputation as Berkeley\u2019s, specially in the tech universe. In fact, for many, many serious and highly dedicated, extremely talented engineering aspirants, Duke is not on their radar.\nIf we\u2019re talking about WS, I agree Duke has more presence there.

Yale\u2019s COA is 280K now.  The answer is different for every family, there is no clear answer.  My short answer above is based on what OP posted - parents could afford to pay their share and OP would come out with 60K loans.  I know so many students who have changed their mind about medical school.\nMy daughter was offered a full tuition at a 2nd tier LAC.  I also had a hard time to walk away from 40K/yr back then, but It was my daughter who said she would be willing to borrow 10k/yr from me to go to an Ivy.  I also thought about what we could do with 200K.  I decided the ROI on my D could be much higher than if I\u2019ve put it in any other investment.\nThere is a discussion on the Parent Forum about if it matters what school your kid goes to, maybe it is worth a read.  From my personal experience, it does matter and it matters more than just the first job.  My older daughter is making top 1% salary at an age of 27 and my younger daughter is finishing up a 2 year internship where they only hired from Ivies and Stanford.  I think her internship helped her greatly in getting into a top 4-5 law school.  We are again at a crossroad of be a full pay at that top law school or take the scholarship from a lower ranking law school.  A very good friend of D2 was just offered an assistant editor job at a major newspaper.  He also went to a top ranking school.  The competition was fierce because the job paid over 70K with benefits.  They had a lot of applicants and they had to use some filters to limit number of people they wanted to interview.\nIf your parents are liquidating their 401K or emptying out all of their savings acct to pay for Yale then your family can\u2019t afford it.  On the other hand, if your parents had put away money and planned on paying for your college (maybe in state), then I wouldn\u2019t miss out on the opportunity of going to Yale.  I am in no way saying one couldn\u2019t get a very good education from UW, but it is different than what you would get Yale.  You need to make a decision as to what it is worth to you (family).\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rutgers University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{\n\n\n Gudmom:\n[quote]\nRutgers is basically a commuter campus.\n[/quote]\n\nhttps://oirap.rutgers.edu/CDS/2017/New%20Brunswick%20CDS_2017-2018.pdf section F1 says that 85% of frosh live in the campus dorms, so it is nowhere close to being a mostly commuter campus.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: New York University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{The above post contains several errors.\nFor example: \"\" And, scholarships will be higher for people with more impressive resumes (i.e. Wharton).\"\" This is as incorrect as a statement can be.

Stern does very well but Wharton does open a few more doors and generally places better. The difference in placlement is probably not substantial enough to pay $184,000 when it creates a burden for your family. The MBA is interesting because it changes the cost dynamic somewhat. I don\u2019t know the actual numbers (OP could look them up if they care) but if 40% of Stern graduates get an MBA while only 20% of Wharton students do, then there\u2019s a 20% chance that Wharton further saves you around $400k all else equal.\nI agree with the above posts though, Stern is the safer path. For certain individuals and certain circumstances it would make more sense to attend Wharton given the edge in placement, MBA necessity, and preference for campus/culture, but it\u2019s dependent on the individual and is a riskier path to take. To be clear, I think In this case Stern seems like the better option unless OP really loves Penn, would consider switching majors potentially, and her parents are able to help with the cost without burdening themselves too much.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Brown University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n{Yes, I can see where you\u2019re coming from too.\nI think with most things what you do matters much more than where you go but there are some exceptions.

Say both jobs are in California. the 70K job will take home about 52K after federal, state, social sec, medicare, etc. The 40K job will take home will take home about 33K for a difference of 19K per year.\nKeeping the arithmetic simple 240K divided by 20K is a 12 year payback. But the arithmetic is not that simple. If the 240K were invested it would likely double resulting in a payback of 24 years. And that assumes that a 22 year old would start saving 100% of the difference between the two jobs, the likelihood of which is about zero. So the real time to pay back easily exceeds a quarter century for most people.\nI am not arguing that making more money is pointless. However, giving up savings and compounding investment returns in exchange for a system of progressive taxation a questionable choice. The same is true on the other end of the workalike calendar. If you are nearing retirement, would you rather have saved more than enough or hope that your final years are the highest paying and maybe you can save the difference realizing that is precisely when companies will wonder about younger, less expensive replacements? I would pick savings.\nA hard to calculate factor is that compensation arc. For the physician, the slope of the arc is zero. It just doesn\u2019t matter where a person did undergrad. For many other jobs, the Ivy league graduate might have an accelerated compensation arc over a career, mitigating the time for payback of the more expensive education.\n\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference"]
