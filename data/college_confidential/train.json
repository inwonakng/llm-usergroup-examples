Yes, my son is a swimmer at Williams and loves it. Of the NESCAC schools we visited, I liked all of them \u2013 Williams, Amherst, Middlebury, and Bowdoin. The coaches were terrific at each school. We really liked Swarthmore, too, and the new coach there, Karin Colby, was terrific. But we shied away from Swarthmore for the same reason you mentioned \u2013 the academic environment seemed a bit intense. Of course, Williams and Amherst are pretty intense, too, but Swarthmore does have a special reputation in that regard. My sense is that Harvey Mudd shares that reputation.\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve gotten the assurances you need at HM \u2013 that your odds of admission are very good. But, as for Engineering, my own personal experience is that there is no undergraduate major more intense. Those who choose that major learn a lot, get a strong degree, and find work. But they don\u2019t have much fun in college. If you\u2019re shying away from Swarthmore because of its academic intensity, then I\u2019d suggest you keep in mind that an Engineering major at HM would be VERY intense \u2013 probably much more than most students at Swarthmore experience. Pre-med at Amherst would be intense but manageable. Of course, I\u2019m just \u201csome guy\u201d with an opinion, but I\u2019d encourage you to give this Engineering some additional thought. I\u2019ve had a dozen or more friends who attempted Engineering in college quickly move on to something else. Even our valedictorian was pulling very low grades at Notre Dame while attempting Engineering \u2013 moved on to something else after the first year and found success. And if you ran into trouble with Engineering at Harvey Mudd, I\u2019m not sure what your other options would be. One last plug \u2013 the NESCAC appears to be a terrific place to swim. And Amherst is a great college town, among the best in the US. If you do apply to Amherst, there\u2019s no harm in reaching out to Rueppel and asking if he would support you for EDII.\nAs for whether to attend a top school for med school, you\u2019ll get lots of opinions here on CC.

She had some good choices, like your daughter, and I didn\u2019t think SMU was going to make the top 3.  After final visits to the other choices - and none of them feeling quite right - she made a trip to SMU by herself for an admitted student weekend.  Within the first few hours, she knew she had found her place.  She works hard at her studies (she is an engineering major) but has had the time and opportunity to be involved with a few campus organizations.  Because she has been involved and met lots of different people, she has had a very good experience so far.  Sounds like your daughter has some great options.  Obviously there were more highly ranked options for engineering schools but we weren\u2019t entirely sure she would enjoy engineering and hoped she would choose a school with lots of other options if she decided to change majors.  Rankings are important, I guess, but we didn\u2019t really care all that much.  Factors like travel distance (she\u2019s 1000 miles away but a short, relatively inexpensive direct flight), job / internship opportunities in large city (Dallas), active campus ministry (we are Catholic), affordability with merit scholarships, and a small, supportive engineering program played into her decision more than any ranking.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Wesleyan University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Trixy34 For the first 4 years it will be the FA from the LAC. The first year of Dartmouth gets treated as a study abroad year. In Hamilton\u2019s case, the cost of attending Dartmouth was about $3K more, so we were responsible for the additional $3K. In the 5th year of the program the student becomes a Dartmouth student where they are then subject to Dartmouth FA. Just want to point out that the curriculum at Hamilton is definitely challenging and will prepare your son well to take on the challenges at Dartmouth, perhaps better than some of the other schools. My son was able to get waived out of two courses and ended up taking more advanced alternatives at Dartmouth. I don\u2019t know the reason for this but it seems, at least for now, that more students pursue this program from Colby, Skidmore and Vassar than from Hamilton.

That experience is probably different from that of most students at Stanford, but it\u2019s limited to 90 students a year.  Also, because they live in a separate dorm, they are somewhat isolated from other students, and I don\u2019t think I ever interacted with anyone from SLE.\nWhen I attended, students were required to take a year-long course in Western Civilization, which was intended to be equivalent to the Great Books curriculum at UChicago and Columbia, and which was supposed to stimulate common discussion among students on a shared reading list.  But we had 9 or so different tracks for Western Civ, each sponsored by a different department, such as history or science and technology, so we never really all read the same set of books.  Anyway, Stanford eliminated its Western Civ requirement 30 years ago, due in part to student pressure, so aside from SLE, there hasn\u2019t been a common core experience at Stanford in a long time.\nStanford has long had a cultural divide between those who major in STEM subjects and those who major in the humanities and social sciences.  Back then, they called each other \u201ctechies\u201d and \u201cfuzzies\u201d, and apparently, those terms are still in use today.  See, for example, this recent commentary from the Stanford Daily about the phenomenon:\nhttps://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/10/31/what-came-first-the-fuzzy-or-the-techie/\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Franklin W.

You mentioned being need blind above \u2013  that means a college won\u2019t reject your application because you need FA, but it has nothing to do with whether they will offer enough aid for you to attend.\nAlso, I get the impression you want to go to med school in the US.  There are a small number of med schools in the US that treat Canadians like US citizens in admission, but nearly all consider them international.

My D1 was a GAP admit a few years back, she had acceptances from Harvard, UPenn and other top schools for undergrad. In her case though, she did not receive any scholarships from either Harvard or UPenn, EFC too high as well.\nShe is at Pitt Med now. She graduated from Pitt with close to a perfect GPA and an MCAT score of 36 and did not even bother applying to other Med schools. She has had a fantastic experience at Pitt, both academically and socially. She has done a volunteer gig last summer in an Argentinian community hospital and has lined up a couple more for next summer. Recently, she and her team were given a sizable grant (from a private drug company) to implement a drug distribution model alongside their Pitt Pharmacy folks in rural China. As a proud parent, I am happy to see her blossom into a terrific young lady. I am very sure the environment at Pitt played quite a big role in this.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Brown University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI get your point and it\u2019s valid.

But the average Princeton student (versus Princeton as an entity) is so darn smart they will succeed at a higher frequency than most other students,  especially in certain academically rigorous professions such as advanced science and research  medicine & academia.

Quality is far more reliant on the professors and the resources offered at the college. One could also argue that open-curriculum schools attract a lot of STEM students who want to avoid taking humanities classes, and indeed, I have heard many STEM students make that claim. So I\u2019d avoid stereotyping and go straight for the facts.\nLet\u2019s also remember that undergraduate students go to get a well-rounded undergraduate education, not specifically to study one thing like a graduate program. It\u2019s important to go to a college with a solid department in the area of interest (particularly if there is interest in doing research), but either Carleton or Amherst will offer that. You could literally flip a coin and be fine. You don\u2019t have to go to the best tippy-top school in a specific discipline to get into a PhD program in that area. What you need is a good solid department and at least one professor who is willing to mentor and shepherd you through for research and grad school. I\u2019m confident you could get that at either college.\nA quick look at the departmental websites show that their physics faculty is about the same size - if I counted correctly, excluding visiting and emeriti professors there are 9 full-time, tenure or tenure-track faculty at Carleton and 8 at Amherst. Amherst\u2019s are, on average, more established in their careers (they are more heavily populated with full professors, who have typically been teaching 12-15+ years), but not by a whole lot - Carleton has one or two more assistant professors, it seems. The faculty at both Amherst and Carleton got their PhDs from physics departments of roughly equivalent quality, on average. A few more of Carleton\u2019s faculty went to higher-ranked programs. Both have solid representation in astronomy and astrophysics, from browsing the catalogs. Amherst may benefit from a close connection with UMass, which has a mid-ranked physics doctoral program.\nI don\u2019t know anything about physical facilities but those can offer a clue to the level of investment (and anticipated enrollments) a college has in particular subject areas.\nI will say, though, that Carleton is a top 10 producer of PhDs more generally and a top 5 producer of PhDs in the physical sciences. Amherst is in the top 30 for science and engineering PhDs overall. That could be due to a lot of different factors, but interest and investment in the sciences might be contributing factors there too. (Pomona is in the top 15 and Williams is in the top 20.

I would not consider a 3+2 program as a realistic option. Very few students end up doing them, which requires switching colleges after your junior year. I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech. Tough decision. If you can visit all of them, that would probably knock one or two of them out.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Northwestern University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rice University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI can assure you that the opinion of @robotrainbow is not reflective of reality.

Look at the top NYC private prep schools / New England private prep schools / CA private prep schools like Harvard Westlake where these students largely can choose wherever they want to go and Northwestern will be in the top 10-15 most represented schools. Rice will not be found. Also, look at the top 10-15 feeder schools to the top MBA programs, and you\u2019ll see Northwestern there. Look at Columbia, HBS, Wharton, Stanford, etc. Rice - no where to be found. Also, look at the incoming Investment Banking analyst classes in NY at the top banks - Northwestern will have a few analysts. Rice may have some students at the Houston offices but usually not in NY.

Just how much is this the case there, and how would it affect someone not active in athletics? (My son played soccer in high school, also some ultimate and tennis, but he is not at a level to play on a college team.)\n[/quote]\n\nI don\u2019t think this will be a big deal at either school. At most schools, even SLACs, athletes (and the men/women attracted to them) often form cliques. It goes hand in hand with team bonding. However, it usually doesn\u2019t affect other students, unless they are dying to be part of who they perceive to be the \u201cin\u201d crowd and get rejected. And we\u2019re not talking about giant powerhouses of NCAA Division I here.\n\n[quote]\nThe study abroad program\n[/quote]\n\nWe like Carleton\u2019s specific options, but both schools will offer excellent opportunities. One difference worth noting: the Carleton trimester-based academic calendar enables a student with demanding academic requirements (for a double major, for example) to go abroad for the six-week winter break (Thanksgiving to New Year\u2019s) or for a 10-week trimester. In the latter case, the student can still take classes in Northfield for the other two trimesters, if desired. (Or you can go abroad for half a year to a year.)\n\n[quote]\nWe\u2019re in Illinois, and one of my son\u2019s preferences is to get out of the midwest. (I\u2019m from the east coast originally, and still have family there.)\n[/quote]\n\nThere you go. Amherst wins, if this is important to your son. For us, it was the opposite. My daughter will be experiencing something very different by going to the Midwest, which is one reason she turned down all of her California choices. I agree with your son that it is important to explore something different.\n\n[quote]\nAmherst\u2019s endowment is quite a bit larger \u2013 does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools?\n[/quote]\n\nNot that I noticed, but there may some advantages. Amherst has a slightly better student:faculty ratio. My impression is that Amherst provides slightly better financial aid, but each person\u2019s experience may be different. On the other hand, Amherst has a higher sticker price, and Carleton spends more on R&D (can\u2019t find my source, but I saw the figures somewhere). So who knows?\n\n[quote]\nFinancial aid: Amherst\u2019s aid is \u201cno loan\u201d. Does that mean we can\u2019t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to? And if we can, would it be on top of the grant they\u2019ve already given us, or would it displace some of it? (Their website seems to suggest the former; I plan to speak with their FA office tomorrow.) With the loan, the FA packages are very similar.\n[/quote]\n\nYou can always borrow a Parent Plus loan up to the expected family contribution. It will not replace any grants or scholarships. Eligibility for Federal Stafford loans, subsidized or unsubsidized, should be stated on the financial aid offer.\nGood luck! As others will tell you, your son can\u2019t go wrong with either choice. Great schools.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pittsburgh\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Deming  If your DS, can get into Yale, he can surely meet 3.75 GPA at Pitts.

Either a 32 ACT score & top 7.5% of high school class, or 34 ACT score & top 10% of one\u2019s high school class. The benefits regarding advising, class registration, special courses & housing can be substantial if one takes advantage of all that is available to them as honors students. In my opinion, the most impact is made during one\u2019s freshman year. You are in the Honors College at IU, but not at UGA.\nIn your sophomore year, as a business major, you may should eligible for Business Honors at IU. Very important for internships, job placement, advising & teacher recs.\nAt UGA you are neither a Foundation Fellow nor a member of the Honors College.\nAT IU. your 32 ACT score just made the minimum cutoff for the Hutton Honors College.

What criteria did you give him/her when applying to schools in terms of what you were willing/able to contribute? What are her social/intellectual/academic wants and needs?\nYes, conventional CC wisdom will tell you to take the money from USC and run. But conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t always provide right answers in every case.\nMy daughter had to make the same choice last year: she was offered full tuition scholarships at USC, Vandy, and Wash U (and others) and had also gotten into HYPS and UChicago (UChicago gave a decent merit and FA combination; HYPS gave very little FA (under 10K) and, of course, no merit.\nThe most important criterion my D had was that she wanted to be around really, really bright kids. Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.\nUSC was not a good fit for my D, despite thinking that it had some interesting programs and seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her \u2013 she would NOT have been happy there). Among her full tuition scholarship options, she liked Wash U. the best.\nMy D, with our unwavering support, chose Stanford and could NOT be happier. To us, it is worth every penny.\nThat said, she is our only child, so we don\u2019t have any more tuitions to pay. We drive old cars and don\u2019t take lavish vacations. My D is not seeking an education as a means to an end \u2013 the only return on investment she seeks (and that we hope for her) is greater knowledge. She will likely end up in a PhD program in the humanities. She loves what she is studying, has had some absolutely amazing and supportive professors, enjoys her fellow students, and finally feels like she has intellectual peers (something she did not have in HS).\nShe has truly found her tribe there and is absolutely, positively 100% certain that she made the right choice. My DH and I are too.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bates College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nMultiple intelligence theory isn\u2019t what most people think it is.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Kenyon College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of California, San Diego\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWith the description of a medical team, I\u2019d be worried about good doctors, hospitals, and health insurance plans.

My D did love the Olin culture and family feel, the unique approach to engineering education etc. Only you can decide if there is a good fit.  Both of these schools are outstanding and though GT has a more recognized brand, most who know both schools know they are excellent and consider them peers. (I\u2019m an engineer myself).\nMy D decided on GT. The gap year definitely played a role but she also felt like she will get the best of both worlds at GT honors - a small community with some small honors classes but in a larger school in a large city that has more opportunities. She knows she will have to seek out many things that would come easier at Olin though, e.g. she will need to get her project experience from clubs, etc.\nGood luck with your decision!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of South Carolina\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\nWhat if you went to USC and decided you made a mistake (or didn\u2019t get into IB), would you be able to 1) afford UMich 2) get into Ross?\n[/quote]\n\nNo, under the new rules you cannot apply to Ross again.

Harvard is the easy and obvious choice here because admission to and payment for medical school is like undergraduate but on steroids.  Admissions rates hover around 3-5% for even a mid level medical school.  Costs are above 80,000 a year right now, and are going to be even higher in four years.  So, when people say take the money at Georgia Tech they are assuming that your chance of admission and cost will be the same.  I disagree.  With 3% admission rates, Harvard is clearly the better choice for admission to medical school, even, as I readily agreed, GT is a great school and a fine choice standing alone.  But, from the financial point of view, what you want for medical school is either admission to a low cost or free medical school (Baylor or Case Western) or merit money from the medical school.  If you don\u2019t get that, medical school is going to cost you nearly 400,000.  The medical schools compete for the very best applicants with merit money.  So, financially, that is the goal, to have such a stellar record that you can go to medical school at a far lower cost, and I would pay 80,000 all day for the chance to a) cut my medical school bill down and b) improve my chances for admission.\nAnd, I am not, really not, picking on GT.  I think it is a great school.  But for kicks, just go to the websites of the top medical schools and see where the students came from.  Harvard, Yale and the like are overrepresented.  (Just to be clear, I did not go to Harvard I am just looking at the facts).  How many GT undergraduates are at Harvard medical school.  How many Harvard undergraduates?\nAnd one more note for admission.  This forum is littered with threads that discuss people who failed to recognize just how tough it is to get into one of the elite schools.  Well, virtually every single medical school is sub-10% admission and requires the whole package of grades, EC, recommendations and more just to be considered. By way of example, George Washington Medical school has a three percent admission rate, lower than Harvard undergraduate.   You can\u2019t just get A\u2019s and get in, any more than you get get into Harvard that way.  All these people just assuming you can go or go to Harvard for med school, as if you could just walk up and get in.  No way.  So, if my dream was to be a doctor, and Harvard could facilitate that, it would be worth 80,000, particularly if was a way to cut down the huge cost of medical school.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rutgers University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nThe living /learning community for male engineering students at Virginia Tech is called Galileo.

It is true that Columbia does not produce detailed salary data, but Penn and Cornell do, as does Michigan, but I would assume Columbia is similar to Penn and Cornell.\nOthers have said it is cost of living that causes Michigan salaries to be lower, but that does not make sense to me because CS majors at top schools all seem to be moving to the same cities. I have no doubt that the best Michigan students can compete with anyone and can command salaries in the $110k - $150k range. However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down.

Told him if he got scholarship from SC he should go there (he is a science/math kid who loves to dance).  So that\u2019s our value.  Each family have their own values.\nWell things do not go as planned.  He decided he wanted to pursue dance (together with bio) so now USC dance program became his #1 choice. Like film school, it\u2019s extremely hard to get in.  He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super \u201cintellectual\u201d kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC\u2019s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.  We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.  Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of North Carolina\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Vincent1997 ,S loved both UNC and USC but did not end up applying to UNC for the reason you mentioned (no guarantee of admit to the business school) plus OOS costs would be higher than merit from a private university like USC. He ended up getting merit at USC but chose another school in the end. Part of the reason was that he realized he did not want to commit to living in Southern California after graduation. Also, it was not the strongest fit after he spent a night there during interview weekend. Other schools did a better job with overnight visits. The University Village is impressive on the outside but less conducive to meeting lots of people as compared with a regular dorm, based on the suite arrangements. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t meet people if you room at the Village. It\u2019s just a little less easy as a dorm such as Birnkrant.\nCosts are also very high (from rent to insurance to gas to you name it) in Los Angeles.That would be true of Boston as well. I think you are smart to consider what your ultimate goal is in terms of living and working after four years. Not everyone knows the answer but in your case, you seem to be pretty certain about working on the East Coast. Marshall Business school is strongest in L.A. and Asia. Many on CC are rah rah about the Trojan alumni network but I don\u2019t think it rings true nearly like in Southern Cal. I would go with your instincts and choose either UNC or BC. If you are like my S, you\u2019ll lean towards the school that is offering you a sure admit into the major you would like to study and where you click with the student body. You can take a chance on UNC and getting into the B school. If you don\u2019t get into the business school, you could probably major in econ or something else. Raleigh would have the second best weather of the choices  but BC offers you the direct admit to the business school in the part of the country that you would like to ultimately work.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Notre Dame\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nStern is more targeted for IB/finance.

I never felt i didn\u2019t have access to my professors at Penn and all classes are taught by professors who also hold regular office hours. The fact that there are more students interested in STEM meant more STEM- oriented student organizations and more like-minded people to learn from. Penn engineering is still at a very manageable size (435 per class is not a lot) but also quite diverse because of its size. Also i feel the research opportunities and stem-related extracurricular involvement are more robust and diverse.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Middlebury College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Haverford College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nHappy for you all.

That is totally incorrect the ivy comment.   In fact I have yet to meet a Brown graduate in my 3 decades on Wall Street.   Lots of Harvard and Penn, but honestly in a quant role people are most impressed by MIT and NONE of the ivies     Also note while there are MIch grads on wall street, there are far more Cornell grads in NYC and better\nnetworking opportunities as a result.\nA typical b-school degree will lead to very different career options than a math/cs focus regardless of the schools selected, so that should be the major deciding factor.   Ithaca is a wonderful college town, I doubt Ann Arbor has anything better to offer in day to day lifestyle than Ithaca, it is often voted one of the BEST college towns.\nFull disclosure, I do have a son at Cornell and less familiar with Michigan, but I know the difference\nbetween b-school and math/comp sci ( I studied comp sci/math/engineering myself and took some b-school classes as electives).  I worked in the quant and IT area of some of the largest best known banks and fund managers. I am a hiring manager and I would take the math/cs/ops research etc grad over any b-school grad in a quant role.

Told him if he got scholarship from SC he should go there (he is a science/math kid who loves to dance).  So that\u2019s our value.  Each family have their own values.\nWell things do not go as planned.  He decided he wanted to pursue dance (together with bio) so now USC dance program became his #1 choice. Like film school, it\u2019s extremely hard to get in.  He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super \u201cintellectual\u201d kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC\u2019s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.  We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.

They tend to foster a great sense of community, and make the university more accessible.  Freshmen are generally undeclared, and the majority of them are not physically housed in the residential college itself (depending on the college), so you would almost certainly be with \u201crandom roommates we\u2019ll probably not be in my major\u201d.  Many students change prospective majors.  All of that is part of the experience of being at a school with a strong liberal arts focus.\nI\u2019m a huge fan of Penn\u2019s dual degree programs, for the right students.  Those students are usually very focused and motivated, and are ready to jump in from day 1.  If you know you want to combine engineering and entrepreneurship, and like the idea of being with a elite cohort of similar students, it\u2019s hard to beat M&T.   The program will certain have extreme rigor and a heavy workload, but I don\u2019t get the sense that most people find the environment toxic.\nBoth are amazing schools, but very different experiences (especially with M&T factored in).  I would think it depends on whether you want a more focused, intense experience in your subjects of interest with a lot of resources and a program tailored to your interests, or a broader, more liberal arts based experience, where you will have to carve out your own path.\nI hope this helps.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Richmond\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Haverford College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n^Well, just to play devil\u2019s advocate for a moment, I would ask, how the OP feels about being a token intellectual within a somewhat larger campus?

Some majors require GPAs as high as 3.2.\n2 and #3 - As your email or letter states, you were accepted into the COLLEGE but with an intended major...but not directly into the major.  You are technically in what PSU calls premajor status. To officially declare your major, you will have to successfully complete several courses with a C or better and hit a certain overall GPA, which varies depending on your major.  Civil engineering requires a 2.6 but biomedical, mechanical,  and chemical require a 3.2.  My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so.\n4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.

That experience is probably different from that of most students at Stanford, but it\u2019s limited to 90 students a year.  Also, because they live in a separate dorm, they are somewhat isolated from other students, and I don\u2019t think I ever interacted with anyone from SLE.\nWhen I attended, students were required to take a year-long course in Western Civilization, which was intended to be equivalent to the Great Books curriculum at UChicago and Columbia, and which was supposed to stimulate common discussion among students on a shared reading list.  But we had 9 or so different tracks for Western Civ, each sponsored by a different department, such as history or science and technology, so we never really all read the same set of books.  Anyway, Stanford eliminated its Western Civ requirement 30 years ago, due in part to student pressure, so aside from SLE, there hasn\u2019t been a common core experience at Stanford in a long time.\nStanford has long had a cultural divide between those who major in STEM subjects and those who major in the humanities and social sciences.  Back then, they called each other \u201ctechies\u201d and \u201cfuzzies\u201d, and apparently, those terms are still in use today.

As you can see from the link you provided, most of the universities at the top are concentrated in California and the East Coast, where the cost of living is significantly higher than the cost of living in the Midwest and the South.\u201d\nThe problem with that is that the top tech jobs are in SF, Seattle, and NYC. Students competing for top jobs are not going to the midwest and south.\nI believe the Michigan places 1/3 at those 4 firms. There is nowhere you can\u2019t reach from Michigan. I just think that Columbia students are probably placed at higher rates in top positions, and also may be likely to be recruited for other options. Finally, all job at Apple, for example, are not the same. A lot of the people working at the Apple store were CS majors. If the student was imagining being a SWE or a PM, that is a lot different. CS salaries seem to be very sensitive to technical skills and I think Columbia pushes students harder to learn more, and starts with stronger students who probably had more CS experience to start.\nAdditionally, it is likely that Columbia students are more likely to have internships and job opportunities at companies right in NYC, where Google owns an entire building, Bloomberg hires many, IBM, Palantir, Jane Street etc.\nThere are also certain positions where a Columbia student would seem to have an advantage of getting included as a candidate. I was talking to a current CS candidate who had a second round tech interview in NYC last week. The person said that there were 6 candidates being interviewed that day, and they were from MIT, Penn, Princeton, Berkeley, and Duke. That has a strong appearance of being a position where the name of the school matters. I do think a Michigan grad can get into that group, but I suspect it would be easier for a Columbia grad. They are both strong brands, but the Columbia brand is very strong in NYC.\nI am not saying that Columbia is a clear choice, I just think that it depends on where the student wants to end up. If they want to be in the midwest, I would lean toward Michigan. If they want to be on the east coast, I would lean toward Columbia. If they want to be in Seattle or SF, I think it depends on what the student values.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Pittsburgh\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nHow high did you score on your three subject tests for Georgetown?

Daughter had the same dilemma last year. She was accepted to all these schools as well as other similar ones. She knew that money was going to be the deciding factor. She was a direct admit to Fisher and she was also able to secure a full-tuition scholarship at OSU bringing the overall cost of attendance on par with UGA (we are instate).  She was also interested in going out of state, Her acceptance to OSU and UGA came in at the same time (the Friday before Thanksgiving). After researching all the programs, acceptances, financials, and location, there is no doubt in my mind that she made the right decision. She absolutely LOVES OSU.\nFinancially speaking, OSU will be cheaper than IU by about $10K to $12K a year. So basically somewhere in between UGA and IU. Fisher is an amazing school perhaps not at the level of Kelley but very very close. Columbus is a city, but by no means, the size of  Atlanta, but lots of Fortune 500\u2019s as well as upstarts are based out of there. It is between Cincinnati and Cleveland not to mention other major cities such as Pittsburgh and Indianapolis. After narrowing down some of her options, she decided that she wanted to be in a city.\nWe looked into Kelley and, it seems that a lot of people think to think they are tops.  IMHO, I do not think they are worth the premium, especially if you are not studying Finance and assuming, of course, you have similar options.  I know you have your hands full and this is not an easy decision. The University of Georgia is an amazing school and it probably would have been the school of choice if she did not attend OSU.  But there is something to be said about Direct admission and wanting to go OOS. But financials matter.   I know you have a lot of friends attending UGA or are going to be attending UGA, but if you want to hear the perspective a current Fisher student from Atlanta, I will be more than happy to get you in touch with my daughter. In addition, I know all these schools offer acceptance students days, etc. You might want to consider going to those in order for you to make sure you get a feel for what is like.\nFinally, when she came home during the winter break, she had a chance to see all her friends who are currently attending other schools from all over the country. Schools such as Wisconsin, Arizona, Alabama, Texas, FSU, and UGA. EVERY SINGLE ONE of these kids loves their schools. They all found the perfect school. It goes to show you that by the end of the day, we all seem to struggle with these decisions, but whether location, financials, or size dictate the outcome, many end up very happy with their ultimate choice.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Alabama\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Fordham University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI think the biggest thing to consider is your parents\u2019 financial position.

Just call the main number (215) 898\u20137507, and ask for admissions. Once you get to admissions tell the person you have been admitted, and that you have some questions and would like to speak with a counselor.\nTalk with the counselor about your concern about grades in pre-med. Ask about what a sample schedule would look like. Ask about research opportunities (Basically any student can get involved in research). Ask about opportunities for pre-meds to get involved in clubs. Ask about opportunities to get guidance about issues like what med school applicants need besides a GPA and an MCAT score. Tell them about your other acceptance too. Let them help you.\nYou should go to Quaker days too, but begin getting more information right away. Knowing more will help you make a better decision.\nAlso, consider the fact that most pre-meds at any college decide not to stay in pre-med. None of those students think it will be them switching out. If that happens to you, you are better off at Penn.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Dartmouth College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAs for the competition part, see here:\nhttps://blogs.hopkins-interactive.com/2016/2013/03/is-hopkins-cutthroat/\nI can also attest students are pretty collaborative at Hopkins.

There is nowhere you can\u2019t reach from Michigan. I just think that Columbia students are probably placed at higher rates in top positions, and also may be likely to be recruited for other options.\u201d\nI don\u2019t see why that would be the case since Michigan and Columbia are considered peer institutions by the firms recruiting their graduates.\n\u201cAdditionally, it is likely that Columbia students are more likely to have internships and job opportunities at companies right in NYC, where Google owns an entire building, Bloomberg hires many, IBM, Palantir, Jane Street etc.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think finding great internships is a challenge for Michigan students. When you have thousands of gifted undergraduate students, companies come to you.\n\u201cThe person said that there were 6 candidates being interviewed that day, and they were from MIT, Penn, Princeton, Berkeley, and Duke. That has a strong appearance of being a position where the name of the school matters. I do think a Michigan grad can get into that group, but I suspect it would be easier for a Columbia grad. They are both strong brands, but the Columbia brand is very strong in NYC.\u201d\nThis is so random it is not even worth discussing. But yes, in NYC, Columbia\u2019s brand exceeds that of Michigan. Then again, it exceeds that of virtually every university in the world save perhaps Harvard, and even that is debatable. But the OP has not indicated that his goal is to live in NYC. In other parts of the country, Columbia\u2019s corporate reputation does not exceed that of Michigan.\nWhen it comes to graduate school or professional placement, Columbia offers no advantage over Michigan. Like I said earlier, when choosing between Michigan and Columbia, one need not concern himself with the quality of those universities since they are roughly equal. If cost is a concern, and one is cheaper than the other, then the cheaper option is the way to go. If cost is not a concern, going for fit is the way to go.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nMy daughter was admitted to UC Berkeley and Duke.  She chose Duke and is currently a freshman.  She is definitely not an engineer type, more of a liberal arts student (although may consider Law or MBA down the road).  It was an easy decision for her.\nDuke doesn\u2019t have a business undergraduate major/minor.  So keep that in mind.  They do have an MMS certificate (you can research that).\nIf you want to pursue CS and work in Silicon Valley, I\u2019d say go to Berkeley without a doubt.  As you know, Berkeley is known for its CS program.  Duke\u2019s engineering programs are quite rigorous though.  It will be a challenging program.  [Did you know the Duke\u2019s Biomedical Engineering program is a top 4 program in the nation?]  The Duke brand name will be good if you decide on medicine or business grad school.  Duke pre-med students have a high success rate at getting into medical school (something like 90% of students).\nMy daughter loves Duke.  She attended most basketball games this year.  Did tenting for the UNC game.  Great school spirit.  She did get tired of taking the bus to/from East/West campus.  She already has a dorm assignment for Sophomore year.  Close to West Union.  Most of her Fall, 2018 classes start at noon.  She is a night owl, so she\u2019s in heaven.\nDuke has a lot of Asian students, but more diversity than Berkeley.  There is a social hierarchy on campus - but this is over-blown and only becomes an issue if you let it bother you.  My daughter joined a sorority but only attends certain events - mainly ones that don\u2019t involve alcohol.  She isn\u2019t a party animal.  She joined a few organizations that she really likes and plans to continue with them next school year.\nGood luck with your decision!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: California Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@eyemgh I\u2019m not sure what your list of tech CEOs prove.

You asked if I liked UGA.  Yes, I did love UGA and the accounting program set me up for success, but that was 27 years ago and I am not you.\nAfter reading all of the new posts I have to reiterate what I posted earlier.  For accounting there is not an academic difference in these two schools.   Employers have been hiring from these two schools for decades and have been shaping the curriculum for decades, and that gives the programs a trade school like feel.  Rankings matter, but when you drill down to something specific like accounting it\u2019s more about your chances of landing a great first job.  Both schools will be heavily recruited by top accounting/consulting firms.\nMBAs were mentioned earlier, and I would recommend not considering that.  I would recommend a masters in accounting, and then after a few years out in the real world decide if you want an MBA.  Both schools will allow you to attend an excellent MBA program.\nWhat brought me back to this thread was that I had dinner last night with the IU grad mentioned above.  We both agreed that within accounting groups our degrees are respected, but outside of that group it\u2019s just a business degree from a state school.  Both of us loved our time in college and feel like it set us up for success.\nGood luck in your search!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Wesleyan University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\n@circuitrider Hey do you know the median salery for Weslyan student in only stem majors\n[/quote]\n\nNo, and I agree with you: I wish all of these Return On Investment (ROI) surveys would break their results out by major; it would make comparing apples to apples much simpler.

But the students are very smart and can handle it.  At orientation, the school stresses how hard it will be, and also stresses how none of you would be here if we didn\u2019t know you can handle it.  But your point is true.  Many hold after school jobs, and nearly everyone participates in clubs and other activities, on top of seemingly endless hours of studying.  And they\u2019re all better for it.  They very quickly learn time management, and naturally push themselves to excel at everything they do, as they\u2019ve been doing their whole lives.  Employers know this.  When they hire GT grads, they\u2019re getting someone very used to high workload and high performance.  This is true of many engineers, but especially prevalent at GT.\nBTW, as example, my son works for a basketball analytics startup, is VP of the sports business club, plays for GT club volleyball, practices with women\u2019s varsity, plays intramurals, goes to every basketball and football game, watches plenty of sports on TV, is active in fraternity with plenty of partying, and still finds time for all that studying.

And Stanford has no shortage of kids that are not the least bit intellectually curious. But the level of discussion in the classrooms and the level of intellectual engagement she experienced was, in the aggregate, qualitatively different among kids at Yale, Stanford, and U Chicago that they were at schools like Vanderbilt, USC, Wash U., etc. (And I agree, getting an overall feel for a school is a bit like blind men poking at an elephant and oftentimes one sees what one wants to see.) Ultimately, for my daughter, it was a matter of not wanting to be a big fish in a smaller pond; she wanted a bigger pond in which to swim.\n(And yes, UChicago was a definite contender but she didn\u2019t want the weather; Yale was initially her top choice until she got to New Haven and hated it; she thought about Reed, but ultimately decided not to apply because they did not offer any merit aid (the only non-HYPS schools she applied to were those that offered significant merit aid and she submitted separate scholarship applications to any school that required them). She would have been all over Deep Springs had they been accepting applications from women last year.\nAnd as @rickle1 points out, there is a \u201cBig difference between \u201cshould I pay vs. could I pay?\u201d If you\u2019re fortunate enough to be in the \u201cShould I pay\u201d group, really think about the \u201cwhy\u201d. If it\u2019s meaningful, pay, if not, don\u2019t.\u201d It seems that OP is in that group. And @MYOS1634 is quite correct, there are plenty of families that are tempted to pull the rug out from their kids\u2019 feet when faced with this type of decision.\nMy daughter was very, very concerned about the finances and she is very well aware that money that is spent on her undergraduate tuition is money that might otherwise be used for other things (e.g., putting a down payment on a home or investing in stocks). In creating her list, we encouraged her to cast a wide net among in-state publics (UCs), LACs and research universities that offered merit aid, and HYPS, etc. and that we would consider her options when we had the results.\nEvery situation and every family is different. I\u2019m just adding another data point and another point of view.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nCongratulations!

My D has decided to go to Carleton (from warm California). She is also interested in STEM and we found Carleton to have one of the strongest programs, among other things. If your son\u2019s goal is to get out of the Midwest, I think discussing your topics is a moot point. Both schools offer equally strong liberals arts education, but they are different in vibe.\nAnother question to ask him though: does he want to live and work on the East Coast right after graduation? If so, Amherst will have more name recognition there than Carleton for recruiting by employers who are clueless about SLACs. On the other hand, Carleton is better known in the Midwest and among friends in our community, here in California (which is the second biggest supplier of Carls after Minnesota). But in the end, both schools have strong reputations and alumni networks, and both are highly regarded by grad schools, if that is your son\u2019s goal. And among employers who know SLACs, both will have equal standing.\nResponses to your topics, PART 1:\n\n[quote]\nHe plans to study Physics (and go on to grad school). The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations. My impression is that Carleton\u2019s Physics program is stronger than Amherst\u2019s.\n[/quote]\n\nMy friends who are physics faculty at top universities (including a college roommate who is a physics professor at Stanford) seem to think Carleton has one of the strongest programs while Amherst is known more for its strength in the humanities & social sciences. This is reflected in the breakdown of students by major too. However, Amherst is an amazing school and I\u2019m sure your son will get a great science education in either school. Incidentally, physics is one of my D\u2019s interests. BTW, did your son get a nice letter from the Carleton physics department chair, Prof. Pattanayak? If he listed Physics as an interest on Common App, he should have.\n\n[quote]\nThe general campus atmosphere: My son prefers an open, collaborative, diverse, somewhat laid-back environment.\n[/quote]\n\nAmherst is more diverse ethnically. They have recently made a push to recruit URMs, and the very fact that the college president\u2019s quote on diversity was a topic for the Common App writing supplement speaks volumes about their priorities.\nCarleton is 60% White. However, Carleton tries hard to make their student body as diverse as possible, given that Minnesota doesn\u2019t attract as many minority students, and they love international students. Moreover, our impression is that the students are very respectful of other cultures, open-minded about diverse ideas and customs, and welcoming of diverse students. (We are Asian American.) Diversity can also refer to interests and personalities, and Carleton is definitely diverse in that sense. My wife and daughter attended the International Festival last Saturday while visiting Carleton and saw evidence of this. Plus, they explicitly asked minority students whether they felt uncomfortable there. Except for one African American male, most said that they never felt excluded or uncomfortable. One African American male from L.A. went so far as to say that he has never worried about being profiled or harassed by cops in the Twin Cities or Northfield, which is a far cry from his lifelong experience in diverse Southern California. (St. Olaf, however, is a different story. Read the news to learn what\u2019s happening there. But right-minded students are standing up against hate and protesting against the administration, which has apparently done nothing to combat the racist acts.)\nOur takeaway from visits and conversations was that Carleton is one of the friendliest, most supportive, and most collaborative colleges out there. And while the academics are intense, they are pretty laid back, or at least they don\u2019t overtly give off a competitive vibe. Amherst seemed more \u201cclassic New England competitive\u201d to us, and students didn\u2019t appear as happy on the surface, but I don\u2019t want to generalize based on our experience at one point in time. You\u2019ll find all kinds of students at both schools, and I\u2019m sure your son will find a core group of friends who will make his college years a positive experience. Faculty at both schools are great.\n\n[quote]\nThe kind of students who go there: To give an idea, one thing he really liked about Carleton, in a survey asking students what word they\u2019d use to describe students there, \u201cquirky\u201d was the top choice (at another school, it was \u201chipster\u201d, which he didn\u2019t care for).\n[/quote]\n\nPSA: Some past and present Carls are requesting that people get over the \u201cquirky\u201d label.  However, it is true that students at Carleton come from colorful backgrounds, which makes life more interesting. I can tell you that we found the students (and other college community members) to be the friendliest and most down-to-earth of the 30+ colleges we visited. EVERYONE would stop and talk at length about everything we wanted to know, and if they were rushing to class, they would offer to drag my daughter along with them to class, introduce her to professors, and treat her to coffee and lunch afterwards. How cool is that? This is precisely why she fell in love with that place.\nOur tour guide at Amherst was friendly, but aren\u2019t all of them expected to be? The average student we intercepted to chat seemed to be in a hurry to get away, no matter the time of day. Not a reason to judge an entire school, but we couldn\u2019t help coming away with certain perceptions of the campus culture.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pomona College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Drawcodawn absolutely.

Here\u2019s my very rough description of what I think is going on, using made-up (but I believe plausible) numbers - please correct me if you disagree.\nThe population that applies to HYPSM each year consists of, I\u2019m going to guess, something around 125,000 unique applicants, competing for something over 9,000 total offers of admission, with total freshman enrollment at the five schools of something over 7,000 (i.e., there are about 2,000 cross-admits across the five schools).  I\u2019ll guess that half of the applicants are unqualified and are denied on first reading.  Then let\u2019s say that across the five schools 850 of the slots go to recruited athletes and a similar number go to legacies.  I\u2019ll assume that one in five of these gets one cross-admit to another school in the group (bearing in mind that although the athletes are talented, they\u2019re mostly recruited early and often don\u2019t apply to more than one of HYPMS, and although the legacies may be high-quality, the hook only works in one place).  I\u2019ll assume 2,400 other HYPSM legacies are denied at their legacy school as well as all the other four.  So now we\u2019re at 58,400 remaining applicants for 7,960 remaining offers.\nBear with me at this point - I\u2019m going to allude to race, but I believe my points are noncontroversial, and I apologize if I inadvertently offend anyone.  I\u2019m not aiming to provoke a discussion about race in college admissions, or to opine about what colleges should be doing in this area, so I hope no one will go there.\nI estimate there are about 1,200 URM matriculants among HYPSM in each year.  The population of URMs that test in the top 1% of their racial group is, I estimate, a few thousand.  I believe a large number of these academically elite URMs who apply to any of HYPSM will get an offer, and that they are very likely to be cross-admitted.  Let\u2019s say 600 of the academically tippy-top URMs apply to at least one of HYPSM and get 1.5 offers each on average.  The remainder of the admitted URMs overlap with other groups described herein.  This takes us to something like 57,800 remaining applicants for 7,060 remaining offers.\nNow to the ORMs.  Of the ~125,000 unique applicants to HYPSM, I\u2019m going to assume that 21,500 are either Asian-American or international (principally Asian), since that number is roughly equivalent to the top 10% of Asian-American high school seniors (somewhat less than that number will apply, and I\u2019m assuming it gets made up by internationals).  Let\u2019s say roughly 1,500 will ultimately matriculate across HYPSM, and that they\u2019ll get 1.25 HYPSM offers each on average (i.e., one in four gets two offers, the rest get one).  The other 19,000 are denied.  That brings us down to 37,300 applicants for 5,185 remaining offers.\nLet\u2019s say each school has 50 (for a total of 250) miscellaneous other \u201cinstitutional priorities\u201d on average (development case, celebrity or celebrity offspring, from the 50th state, faculty brat, child of a foreign government official, very strong in some sport that doesn\u2019t get a recruit spot, contrabassoon virtuoso, Broadway performer, published author or other unique talent, etc.) and they get 1.5 offers each on average - now we\u2019re at 37,050 applicants for 4,810 remaining offers.\nAssume 300 unquestionable geniuses, who get 2 HYPSM offers each on average - we\u2019re now down to 36,750 applicants for 4,210 remaining offers.\nI\u2019m going to guess most of the desired number of first-gens at each school has been reached via overlap with the athletes, URMs and other institutional priorities groups, but let\u2019s assume another 500 across the five schools are admitted (e.g., through QuestBridge) and get 1.2 admits each on average.  Now we\u2019re at 36,250 applicants for 3,610 remaining offers\nAt this point, we get to everyone else and individual results become much less predictable - did the rest of your package, i.e., your essays, recommendations, etc., speak to the adcoms in the right way?  Did you convince them that you and the school are a perfect match?  Some of the best unhooked or weaker-hooked kids may have lightning strike in more than one place, because they have an unusual story.  I think 2,600 students or so divide those 3,610 remaining offers; the other 33,650 are denied.\nSo, let\u2019s check the math:  125,000 applicants, less 62,500 denied for being unqualified, less 2,400 denied legacies, less 19,000 denied ORMs/internationals, less 33,650 others denied equals 7,450 HYPSM matriculants - pretty close to the aggregate number of 7,217 posited by @spayurpets in last year\u2019s compilation of admissions data.\nThe numbers also add up to 2,060 cross-admits among the HYPSM schools.  Since there are 10 possible two-school cross-admit pairs, this means that there are just over 200 cross-admitted students on average for each two-school pair, which seems in line with the Stanford faculty senate numbers. Bear in mind that each school hands out about 2,000 admits, so the cross-admit percentage is roughly 10% with any other school.\nYes, I know this is a gross oversimplification and people will have differing opinions as to the size and composition of the groups, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a million miles from the truth.  One can see how these schools could have processes that are more similar than different, but that the aggregate number of cross-admits could still be pretty small.  This is, in my opinion, because large percentages of cross-admits tend to be found in groups that have small numbers (e.g., elite URMs, institutional priorities and unquestionable geniuses, all of whom are rare and highly-prized), while for the larger groups (e.g., ORMs/internationals and the unhooked), chances are that different (albeit possibly overlapping) subsets will be admitted at each of HYPSM because the large numbers make individual admits less predictable.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n&lt;also, duke=\"\"\"\" has=\"\"\"\" almost=\"\"\"\" twice=\"\"\"\" as=\"\"\"\" many=\"\"\"\" rhodes=\"\"\"\" scholars=\"\"\"\" berkeley=\"\"\"\" (despite=\"\"\"\" being=\"\"\"\" a=\"\"\"\" fraction=\"\"\"\" of=\"\"\"\" the=\"\"\"\" size).=\"\"\"\" not=\"\"\"\" bad=\"\"\"\" for=\"\"\"\" \u201cparty=\u201d\"\" school\"\".=\"\"\"\"&gt;&gt;&lt;/also,&gt;\nBerkeley has faired better on a world class ranking stage.

Based on my daughter\u2019s experience, I had assumed that finding a lab assistant position within a week of freshman orientation was the rule rather than the exception, but apparently, that\u2019s not true everywhere.  Even things like having those opportunities on campus may be a factor to consider.  Access to key ECs and the opportunities they offer may also vary from school-to-school.\nFinding a mentor and developing relationships with faculty is another relevant factor that may be easier at a smaller school or at a school where a student is at the top of the academic heap as well.\nAnd, honestly, finding a school that \u201cfits\u201d and where the student feels they can \u201cstretch comfortably\u201d seems to encourage appropriate course selection and enables the student to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves.\nMed schools are looking for students with high GPAs and MCATs, but my guess is that students who are \u201con the bubble\u201d in terms of academic preparation are better served by looking for a school where they can maximize their potential rather than one where they think they might be able to get an extra .05 out of the grading system.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Virginia\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nBoth great  options.

I would not consider a 3+2 program as a realistic option. Very few students end up doing them, which requires switching colleges after your junior year. I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech. Tough decision.

The risk of going to a school that trains for a job is that the skills you learn will become obsolete in ten years.\nAlso no school is going to get you a job, let alone a high paying job.  That is up to you.  While there are certain majors that tend to pay more after graduation, the simple fact that you graduate in that major doesn\u2019t mean you will get a high paying job.\nI know it is difficult, but look at salary and compensation over the long run, not for the year after you graduate.

The family has strong connection with both CU and Michigan. Children attended thses schools, though not CS, and are doing well. We often have similar discussions at home now that the fourth generation is entering the colleges. I will write what all of you know, but are debating based on personal preferences and bias.\n\nIn terms of placement, Michigan is pretty good. CU is equally good,could be better in programs offered in liberal science and arts.\nThe top tech companies, are not so concerned about the Ivy Tag, and will recruit the best irrespective of the brand. Just not Michigan or Berkeley, even UIUC, Georgia Tech, UT Austin are very favourite grounds of the top tech companies.\nMany of the lead recruiters are not from Ivy League and have firsthand experience of students coming from public or non-ivy private universities.\nIt is true many parents would like to see their children attending Ivy league or top private universities over top public universities. It is based on the value that we attach to a brand that fits into overall public perception.\nGood students excel any way and the decision of the schools they attend is also based on the cost of attendance and other preferences, be it place, sports, music, culture. My grand nephew preferred Northwestern over Columbia because he felt the Evanston campus will provide him with better college experience that the CU campus. Very personal and I don't think, we can say whether he was right or wrong.\nLots of statistics are being dished out.

It is located not too far from the busy Interstate 95 highway corridor. UR\u2019s campus is in the sprawling suburbs of Richmond, about 10 mins. from downtown areas, including the very fun Carytown area, which is popular with students. There is lots of shopping, grocery stores, good access to medical care, etc. in the surrounding areas.\nRichmond and its suburbs are certainly smaller and less populous than Philly and its suburbs, but hardly rural. Areas west of Richmond, heading towards the mountains in Shenandoah and the Charlottesville area where UVA is located are much more rural. That area is lovely with lots of farms, vineyards, parks and hiking, scenic views.\nRichmond has 2 Amtrak rail stops, 1 downtown and 1 in the suburbs, which many UR students use. Richmond also has an international airport, although not gigantic, and the campus has shuttles available to accommodate student travel for breaks.\nUR runs also shuttle buses to several shopping areas as well as to downtown Richmond. Students also use Uber ride sharing to get around, and many students have cars on campus, since parking is plentiful and inexpensive (although a car is not necessary, neither of my UR grads had one).\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@PurpleTitan and they suffer the consequences of that by not attracting tippy top applicants.

All these students are fighting for the same internships.\nAs another poster pointed out, many seem to think that Kelley is as prestigious as Wharton. Not even close! It is not nearly as difficult to get into Kelley or IU as it is to get into Penn. I often hear \u201cwhere do you go to school? I go to Kelley\u201d  Please!!! Having said that, Kelley is a great school and IU is a great University. But overall, if the student is not a 100 percent sure that they are not going to stay in the Business School, the other schools have a better overall reputation. Also, when comparing pay scales between say Kelley and Terry, you have to remember that Kelley tends to send a lot of kids into Markets such as Chicago and NYC whereas UGA tends to send more students into Atlanta, Charlotte, and smaller cities in the South. The pay scales are different.\nThe OP and many who are in similar situations have to decide what makes sense to them. There are so many students whose parents can afford to send their kids just about anywhere. The difference between $100K to go out of state or stay instate might not mean anything. Is Kelley worth $100K more than UGA? Probably no.  But there are so many factors to consider.  The fact is that the in-state school will always cost much much less than the OOS school unless the students can secure close to an OOS waiver in order to make it somewhat cost competitive. So anyone applying to an OOS public should know all the scenarios.\nAlso, there is so much information out there in regard to scholarships, acceptances, etc.  It is a known fact that OOS applicants to IU with target scores can qualify for a scholarship that amounts to about $10K. The Ohio State University tends to offer about $12,500 and sometimes a little more with their Buckeye Scholarship. Anyone prior to applying should have known that there were going get x amount at IU, OSU, and UGA and with that all the what-if scenarios.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@privatebanker:\n\u201cThere are many doctors researchers professors and other really smart and successful grads that come out of USC.\u201d\nThat is definitely true.\n\u201cBut a candidate from USC could easily be in the same PhD program post grad with them and would be very intellectual indeed.\u201d\nYes, some USC grads do go on to get PhDs, but a far smaller proportion of the student body than at HYPSM or the U of C.\nAnd yes, it\u2019s an overgeneralization, but I think you\u2019d find that a significantly smaller portion of the USC student body go there mainly or solely for the pursuit of knowledge.

An engineering grad with project experience (and the leadership/teamwork/success/failure/etc that comes with it) is certainly desirable.  Keep in mind, though, that every engineering program includes a capstone project.  No matter what school you attend, you will graduate with project experience.  Research institutions are not just for research.  They can also turn out well rounded applicants.  As I said, Olin is great for the right person.  But it\u2019s not the only great place out there.\nI\u2019ll give you a real world example of presence of grad students for connections.  My son happens to be at GT.  He recently applied for co-op with Coke, perhaps the most desirable co-op at GT.  His fraternity brother is now a grad student, who happened to have the exact co-op position last year.  Even had the same boss.  He coached my son through the whole interview prep, all the hot buttons to push, basically giving him the playbook to nail the interview.  Which he did, just last week.

Olin College of Engineering\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nOlin comment based on recent questions/discussions above:\n\n[QUOTE=\"\"\"\"]\nTIME/JOBS - My son did have some minor campus employment (interesting stuff, but he did not earn a lot of money).  During senior year he continued his summer gig, a few hours per week remotely (and then went to same place after graduation).  All four years he did A LOT of EC, even though the academic workload/projects were intense.  However he often sacrificed sleep, not uncommon at engineering schools.\nGPA - There seems less focus than other schools, partly because there is high demand for graduates.   The good thing is that Olin (and MIT and Harvey Mudd and I think some other engineering schools) have pass/fail first semester.  That allows students to get accustomed to college. Also they can learn that collaborative learning is good (and real life!) without worrying about who gets the top grade.   You\u2019d think it would make students lazy, but they work surprisingly hard even in the first semeser.\n\u201chand-on\u201d - Olin haslots more project work than my engineering program and more than most other programs today.  It is not a vocation-tech kind of thing, w/o mathematical analysis. The technical analysis is often paired with practical uses.   I assume there is less probably less problem set kind of learning than I had.\nFIT - It is important for a student to be a good match at any school.  But it\u2019s especially critical at teeny school, even more so at Olin since the work is so hard.   It works best if the student absolutely loves the environment and the learning approach.   I often encourage students to put Olin on \u201cthe list\u201d to learn more about project-based learning and hone their education preferences.   But due to it\u2019s low acceptance rate and the fact that it is a niche-fit, I never push hard on it.\n[/QUOTE]\n\nAnother thing I should mention is that small schools have few majors, so  opportunity for switching is very limited.   If you evolve to a major not offered, you need to transfer.  Due to Olin\u2019s non-traditional course sequences, it might be hard to transfer credits.  (Not sure - a very high percentage of students stay.)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Boston College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of North Carolina\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Vincent1997 I think you are still waiting to hear from USC?

I don\u2019t believe LACs without engineering are even eligible to apply, since ABET is an engineering based institution. As mentioned, the CS outcomes from Pomona are phenomenal, with students readily landing tech jobs at the top companies and graduate school destinations. If there\u2019s some evidence that Pomona CS students are suffering in comparison to students from other schools, I\u2019d like to see it. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Alphabet all recruit across the 5Cs, and while I don\u2019t believe Netflix does, I just found 10 Pomona alumni who are presently working there and 7 at Mudd through LinkedIn. I could easily reach out to them. Tech recruiting is not something that the CCs are weak at. And as previously mentioned, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone from Pomona complaining that their education did not serve them well for grad school.\n\n\nI was referring to this: http://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2017/08/02/2017-grateful-grads-index-top-200-best-loved-colleges/\n\n\nIt\u2019s silly to discount Pomona as \u201cisn\u2019t even the top ranked LAC in US News\u201d. Johns Hopkins \u201cisn\u2019t even the top ranked university in US News\u201d, so don\u2019t bother with them. Doesn\u2019t that sound absurd? If we\u2019re going by rankings that actually are combined, Forbes ranks Pomona 10th (including the #1 LAC) and Hopkins 30th, while Times/WSJ rates Pomona 26th and Hopkins 17th. That\u2019s hardly any different.\n\n\nI can tell you that people constantly turn down Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, U of M, and yes, Harvey Mudd, alongside other distinguished CS programs to come to Pomona. Ask the CS majors at Pomona what other schools they were considering, and you\u2019d be surprised. There is no denying the research powerhouse strength of Johns Hopkins and its name brand, as well as the fact it has a larger, more resourced (not necessarily BETTER- in terms of quality of teaching, undergrad focus, community, etc) department. This is a classic case of small LAC vs. big university, and there are genuine reasons for picking the former without resulting in anything significant to one\u2019s potential outcomes. LinkedIn Career Insights lists the six most similar schools to Pomona as Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford, Brown, Yale, and UChicago. It may not have the same name brand as Hopkins, but at least in the USA, the people who recruit and read applications hold it to high esteem. For graduate school, it has a track record of sending students to distinguished programs. I can\u2019t speak about the Bay, but I have experience with the east coast and found Pomona to be largely recognized.\nThe advice about connecting with students and alumni directly is good, though. It would be good to get some perspective from undergrads at either schools to better understand the strength and weaknesses of each program, as well as alumni about how their school prepared them.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWhat made you apply to Wesleyan and Hamilton in the first place?

She had some good choices, like your daughter, and I didn\u2019t think SMU was going to make the top 3.  After final visits to the other choices - and none of them feeling quite right - she made a trip to SMU by herself for an admitted student weekend.  Within the first few hours, she knew she had found her place.  She works hard at her studies (she is an engineering major) but has had the time and opportunity to be involved with a few campus organizations.  Because she has been involved and met lots of different people, she has had a very good experience so far.  Sounds like your daughter has some great options.  Obviously there were more highly ranked options for engineering schools but we weren\u2019t entirely sure she would enjoy engineering and hoped she would choose a school with lots of other options if she decided to change majors.  Rankings are important, I guess, but we didn\u2019t really care all that much.  Factors like travel distance (she\u2019s 1000 miles away but a short, relatively inexpensive direct flight), job / internship opportunities in large city (Dallas), active campus ministry (we are Catholic), affordability with merit scholarships, and a small, supportive engineering program played into her decision more than any ranking.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nOn the West Coast either a USC or Stanford degree will be equally helpful.\nI say that because the Trojan Family Alumni net work is very strong in the west.\nHarvard is Harvard, and a degree there is known everywhere.\nBut neither a Stanford or Harvard degree is worth $300000 more than a degree from USC.\nIf he is going to major in Economics then save the $$ for an MBA, or a MS in Economics.\nBoth will cost you a LOT.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: California Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\nEngineering is VERY egalitarian.\n[/quote]\n\nI\u2019m not so sure.

Can\u2019t go wrong! Each is a little different, and take my impresions with a grain of salt as they are subjective of course. I think (overall) all three schools are pretty equal in your academic areas of interest- some might be stronger than others in certain areas but overall it\u2019s relative as all three are top notch schools.\nBates- wonderful community. Gorgeous (although small) campus/architecture. Very friendly vibe, students are welcoming and the close knit community feel is palpable. Strong academics, just a lovely school. Has the month long May plan which is useful for starting summer internships early or for traveling abroad. Major difference to me between it and the other two is a more laid back vibe. Doesn\u2019t feel as intense. Definitely collaborative. Best food of the three. Nephew is a current student. D15 would have applied regular decision if her ED school had fallen through. Bates is very high on D18\u2019s list this year.\nBowdoin- neat school. Lovely campus in it\u2019s own quirky way. Location near Portland is nice, it is more suburban than rural if that matters to you. Great if you like the ocean. Pretty far away from mountains though if you like having them in your back yard. Of course great academics. Personally, I sensed a little more academic elitism at Bowdoin than the other three. I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, and perhaps I have used the wrong word. Just seemed a little bit more academcially snobby than the other two. Not sure how collaborative/competitive, don\u2019t know enough kids who go there.  D15 liked Bowdoin a lot, would have applied if her ED school fell through. D18 didn\u2019t even look at Bowdoin, too intense of a school for her.\nMiddlebury- awesome location in the mountains, lovely campus. Feels considerably bigger than the other two schools. D15 went ED and attends. Loving her expereince, it is the right mix of academic intensity and fun for her. Raves about (most) of the professors/classes she has taken. Has found Midd more collaborative than competitive (she is env policy major). Heavily involved in the Mountain Club. Knows women on the cross country/track team and they are a great group. Jan Plan is very popular- fun to have the one block class in the middle of ski season. Lots of students ski. D18 not interested in Midd, a bit too intense for her.\nGood luck!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nHow sure is your S about BME?

Those numbers would be at or above what schools like Stanford, Harvard, and Yale reported this year.  At least from 2014-2016, JHU was ranked around 20 or so for entering student testing (one source here: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-50-smartest-colleges-in-america-2016-10) so going to top 5 or so is a big shift.\nPomona\u2019s numbers have actually come down slightly despite more and more applicants, and I think it\u2019s due to the opposite effect. They\u2019ve cut down on a numbers driven process (at one point, Pomona was ranked 5th in the nation for highest entering student stats) in pursuit of a holistic one, though they still want top students (hence the high % ranked in the top 10%). Pomona has had the highest percent of underrepresented minority students of any highly ranked LAC or university for the past two years, alongside their commitment to socioeconomic diversity (top 10 by a ranking in NYTimes and one of only three private colleges to be there; JHU ranked 72), first-gen students, rural representation, QuestBridge, two cohorts of Posse, and other community-based partnerships.\nFurthermore, compare what each admissions website has to say:\nJHU: https://apply.jhu.edu/application-process/\nWe\u2019re looking for students who can think beyond their limits, who don\u2019t see \u2018impossible\u2019 as a roadblock, and who will not only elevate themselves, but also those around them.\nPomona: https://www.pomona.edu/admissions/apply\nEvidence of:\nInvestment and involvement in a community or passionate pursuit\nA love for learning, and a willingness to challenge yourself and go outside your \u201ccomfort zone\u201d\nAn openness to new ideas and rejection of easy answers\nAn appreciation for a collaborative learning environment\nPersonal character \u2014 be it grit, kindness, diligence or serving others\nRisk-taking and adventurousness\nCreativity and innovation\nAppreciation for the visual and/or performing arts\nIs one harder to get into? I feel like a high stats student with good ECs and clear ambition could potentially count on getting into JHU in a way they can\u2019t at Pomona. OTOH, the students scoring the 30 or below at Pomona might not be able to get into JHU.\nI don\u2019t think this is too important to a decision making process in particular, but I do find it intriguing that the schools look for different things.

You can bloom if planted in either place.\nYou haven\u2019t told us enough about what you mean by \u201cgrad school\u201d so we have no way of evaluating whether there\u2019s value in conserving cash for that.  Grad school typically costs little.  Professional school (totally different ballgame) is very expensive.  If you are talking about non-professional grad school, conserving the college fund by going to UMich most likely means that the money would get used for something other than your post-grad education \u2013 like a college fund for your siblings or your kids or a house down payment.\nIf you are talking about getting an MBA when you say \u201cgrad school\u201d, then I\u2019d say save the money and go to a place like Columbia for B school.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Southern Methodist University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYou mentioned on another thread that your daughter was accepted at Mount Holyoke and crossed it off her list.

I\u2019m glad you found something that worked for you and your family!\nYou do not need to start researching grad schools now  It\u2019s too early! Let her settle into some career goals and research/professional interests first. I wouldn\u2019t start thinking about a list until junior year at the earliest, once she\u2019s gotten a chance to get some research experience and a little solidity in her career goals and interests.\n\n\n\nAlso, for the sake of the usefulness of this thread over the long-term your daughter\u2019s doctor is wrong. It is not true that students have to attend a top-tier university to have hopes of getting into graduate school; this is true across fields.* I have a PhD in psychology and I went to a small LAC that is very good but not ranked as highly as Kenyon. Per capita, small liberal arts colleges produce more PhD graduates than large research universities. Colleges like Kalamazoo, Hillsdale, Allegheny, Hendrix, Franklin & Marshall and Occidental are in the top 50 producers of science and engineering (including psychology) PhDs per capita.\nI wouldn\u2019t say a student is better off at a small LAC. It\u2019s more that a student who has found a good fit school for her can get into graduate school from wherever she goes, as long as she pursues the kinds of experiences that graduate schools value. Assuming that\u2019s a PhD program in psychology, that would be research experience assisting a professor in their research group, summer research experiences (preferably at another campus and/or with other professors, so she can grow her network), presenting research at conferences, maybe getting a publication (not necessary, but a nice cherry on top). They also include good letters of recommendation and writing a strong personal statement that coherently discusses research interests and career goals, but those things tend to come more naturally after a student has had these kinds of experiences and connections. Good grades and high GRE scores are also necessary. And if she\u2019s interested in clinical psychology, clinical volunteering experience is necessary as well.\nA sufficiently motivated student could get that anywhere - a great small liberal arts college or a great large public university. The doctoral students I knew (at my own program and those I created networks with) came from across the spectrum of colleges and universities, from top-tier places to small regional public universities.\n*I should add that in some fields - like math or philosophy - undergrad college may matter more.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Vassar College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Kenyon College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAs the one person here who has a child who attends Kenyon, I encourage you to carefully consider my opinion and my daughter\u2019s experience.\nA little background. My daughter is not a city, private school kid. She was educated in a public school system in rural New England. At Kenyon she has many friends from all sorts of places and backgrounds. While diversity might be an issue, the school has made a serious effort to attract a diverse student body. These efforts have resulted in the most diverse first-year class in the school\u2019s history.\nConfederate flags. I have driven to Kenyon five times. Not once have I seen a Confederate flag. Do the residents of the surrounding area lean right? Yes. Has that adversely affected my daughter? No. Area residents are friendly, down-to-earth and kind. We have had numerous interactions in local businesses and not once felt out-of-place or unwelcome. The faculty and student body lean left, and there is an active, vibrant social justice element on campus. How do I know this? Because my daughter is part of it. She has participated in numerous peaceful protests, made a trip to North Dakota during her first year to support the NoDAPL movement, and currently lives in program housing with Eco-Kenyon, which is the school\u2019s environmental club.\nAs for a snobby, self-absorbed student body, this simply is not the case. Her experience, and mine when visiting, could not be further removed from this notion. We found happy, friendly students, a helpful, genuine admissions staff, and an overall pleasant atmosphere throughout campus when we initially visited. This first impression has continued to be her experience.\nGreek life at Kenyon? Yes, it exists, but for those who (like my daughter) don\u2019t choose to join, there are plenty of  alternative social options.\nMy daughter loves her school, so much in fact that after considering the prospect of junior year abroad, she chose to remain at Kenyon. She has had fantastic, inspiring, kind and supportive professors. Her classroom experience has been enhanced by engaging and intellectual peers.\nSo, OP, my advice to you would be to thoughtfully consider what you felt when visiting these schools. As it went with my daughter, Vassar and Wesleyan were both on her list. We visited each more than once, as they were of great interest to her. She also loved Hamilton, even more than these two schools. Ultimately, though, after a deferral ED1 at Hamilton, we visited Kenyon and it rose to the top as an ED2 choice. She couldn\u2019t be happier with her decision.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pomona College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Drawcodawn\nhere are the pomona destinations post graduation by major for the most recent 3 classes.\nhttps://www.pomona.edu/administration/career-development/where-grads-go\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYes.

To begin with, over the course of a succesful career in medicine, 60,000 is effectively meaningless.  Just do the math of lifetime earnings of a physician.  To turn down a superior opportunity over 60,000 is poor thinking.  So, is Yale superior?  The posters keep saying it doesn\u2019t matter where you go undergraduate for med school admissions, but that is absolutely false.  Yale, as a matter of fact, gets a higher percentage of students, at a lower GPA, then Madison into medical school.  Medical school admission rates are as low as Stanford and Harvard for undergraduate.  Wouldn\u2019t you want every advantage.  And to suggest that because people at Yale are smarter than people at Madison that your grades will be lower proportionately, is also not factual.  Top schools are known for grade inflation and helping students.  And Madison has many talented students in pre-med.  The idea that you can breeze through pre-med weed out courses at Madision and would struggle at Yale is simply guess work.  But the flawed nature of the advice, even from a financial perspective, comes out when you take a closer look at med school admissions and merit aid.  Top med schools also have better financial aid and better MERIT aid.  If you do well at Yale, you will be much more likely to be accepted at a top medical school with better aid and medical school is much much more expensive than undergraduate.  And if you want MERIT aid for medical school, you better be a top top applicant.  Now, if the amount is 240,000, that is different story because then you may end up borrowing on top of that amount for medical school, and that total number will balloon. I am not knocking Madison at all.  Great school.  But the poor advice here needs to be addressed.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of North Carolina\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@vincent1997 there are a lot of lovely tucked away areas on the USC campus to get personal space.

It is the polar opposite of a frat-dominated college.\nTheatre is big and wonderful at Vassar. So is social justice.

The risk of going to a school that trains for a job is that the skills you learn will become obsolete in ten years.\nAlso no school is going to get you a job, let alone a high paying job.  That is up to you.  While there are certain majors that tend to pay more after graduation, the simple fact that you graduate in that major doesn\u2019t mean you will get a high paying job.\nI know it is difficult, but look at salary and compensation over the long run, not for the year after you graduate.  Try to figure out what you like to do.   Chances are you will make much more money over your career in a field that you love than in a relatively high paying field that you don\u2019t care for.\nThis probably doesn\u2019t help choose a school.

So he wasn\u2019t dating anyone at Bowdoin during his time there.\nMy S is not outdoorsy at all, and was not an athlete, but he does love cold weather. He had never been in the state of Maine before he did a trip the summer before his senior year of high school, but fell in love with Bowdoin and applied ED.\nI think both schools are academic peers.

I can only speak from experience. In-state students at Michigan have lower tests scores than OOS students, but in the classroom, they perform just as well. The in-state students I knew, and I confess to have only know a few dozen, never prepared for standardized tests. This was strange to me because like most OOS students, I worked hard on my SAT preparation. That is why I said that there is a fundamental difference in paradigm to consider when comparing test scores at public universities and private universities. As it is, I am not sure if anybody can differentiate between a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA and an average SAT/ACT of 1410/31.5 and a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA having taken similar classes, and an average SAT/ACT of 1480/33. But when you factor in the effort, or lack thereof, that in-state students at top public universities put into their standardized test preparation, the gap in test scores is likely even smaller.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@StevensPR RD yield cannot  be greatly  manipulated through waitlists.

There are exceptions such as being an Ivy or an elite Catholic but neither applies to Rice.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: McGill University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Mount Holyoke College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\u201cBut then I was told that this is only the case with the Science courses and its not like that in the Arts\u201d\nI have heard that this is also true in the faculty of arts.

Pritchard is social but not nicer than Lee. But if you are concerned about work environment for freshman year, the engineering community helps for environmental reasons - no crowds wandering the halls when you are trying to study for a chem test - because they all have the same test.

Further, Admissions Dean Richard Shaw talks about the admissions \u201csystems\u201d at the top 5 being quite similar, so that the overlap is highest here (p. 24 of https://stanford.app.box.com/s/y4abufqg66nte7uax6eq).\nWhat this demonstrates, then, is the extraordinarily small number of cross-admits who get into a top 5, but then choose to go elsewhere.  In the report, Stanford lists its top 12 admissions competitors (with UPenn coming in at #11 - an increase from some years back, so, to @Penn95 - a good sign for Penn!).\nThe data is sobering, however.  Stanford now takes 42% of cross-admits with Harvard (up from 35% in years past), and takes the big majority from everywhere else.  Dean Shaw even says that, outside of HYMP, no school takes more than \u201csingle digit percentages\u201d from Stanford.  With Penn at #11 in Stanford\u2019s top competitor pool, and not taking more than 9.9% of cross-admits (in past years, Shaw actually posted the data - and Penn took 2%, but recently he\u2019s stopped even bothering posting data from non-HYMP schools), it means maybe only 5-15 students at Penn turn down Stanford a year.\nBRINGING THIS BACK around to the discussion about Yale - it\u2019s important to remember the numbers here.  As Yale has about a 70% yield rate, and its admissions system resembles Stanford, it stands to reason that it loses the biggest chunk (60-70%) of its cross-admit pool to HMPS.  So, for the 600 students who don\u2019t choose Yale, HMPS probably gets about 400 of them.  There are then only 200 Yale admits who choose to go elsewhere.\nOf that 200, if Penn does phenomenally well, it brings in what, 20 students?  (That would be an extraordinary haul, btw, because it means of the 300+ colleges in america that could be competing for the 200 yale cross-admits not choosing HMPS, Penn would get 10% of them.)  So, all should keep in mind that the universe we\u2019re talking about here is super small.\nIn choosing for fit (which is the key when choosing between somewhat like institutions): Yale has released the survey results from their mental health survey, and the data can be found here: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/586d882946c3c40a1c57b1ee/t/5875baf06a49630b1d28f122/1484110581172/YCC-Mental-Health-Report-1ms1ra1.pdf\nPenn, unfortunately, has not released its own survey results, just its recommendations for an overhaul, as seen here: https://billypenn.com/2015/02/23/experts-students-mystified-by-penn-suicide-task-forces-change-the-culture-mandate-how-exactly-do-you-do-that/\nThere are overlaps between Yale\u2019s extensive report and Penn\u2019s (incomplete) reporting - both schools stress excellence across many sectors, although social endeavors receive more attention in the Penn report.  Further, at Penn, the importance of seeming \u201cperfect\u201d seems more pronounced, whereas at Yale, there seems to be more pressure to appear \u201chappy.\u201d\nYou can also sift through school cultural/inclusion climate reports.  You can find Yale\u2019s here: http://provost.yale.edu/title-ix/yale-report-aau-campus-climate-survey and UPenn\u2019s here: http://www.upenn.edu/ir/surveys/AAU/Report%20and%20Tables%20on%20AAU%20Campus%20Climate%20Survey.pdf\nLots of info to sift through!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Carnegie Mellon University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Maryland\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nNo brainer, UMD.\nIf you want to change his life FAR more than the choice between these schools will make, take half the savings, invest it in a total market fund, and give it to him for a future birthday.\nThe drop out rate at UMD is higher because it\u2019s far less selective than CMU.

What are her social/intellectual/academic wants and needs?\nYes, conventional CC wisdom will tell you to take the money from USC and run. But conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t always provide right answers in every case.\nMy daughter had to make the same choice last year: she was offered full tuition scholarships at USC, Vandy, and Wash U (and others) and had also gotten into HYPS and UChicago (UChicago gave a decent merit and FA combination; HYPS gave very little FA (under 10K) and, of course, no merit.\nThe most important criterion my D had was that she wanted to be around really, really bright kids. Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.\nUSC was not a good fit for my D, despite thinking that it had some interesting programs and seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her \u2013 she would NOT have been happy there). Among her full tuition scholarship options, she liked Wash U. the best.\nMy D, with our unwavering support, chose Stanford and could NOT be happier. To us, it is worth every penny.\nThat said, she is our only child, so we don\u2019t have any more tuitions to pay. We drive old cars and don\u2019t take lavish vacations. My D is not seeking an education as a means to an end \u2013 the only return on investment she seeks (and that we hope for her) is greater knowledge. She will likely end up in a PhD program in the humanities. She loves what she is studying, has had some absolutely amazing and supportive professors, enjoys her fellow students, and finally feels like she has intellectual peers (something she did not have in HS).\nShe has truly found her tribe there and is absolutely, positively 100% certain that she made the right choice.

So it really depends on exactly what type of engineer you want to become, as to whether Caltech is a good fit.  Caltech is more of a chemistry, math and physics focused school, but the math will prepare students for a career in fluid mechanics for instance.  Thats the science that describes how an airplane moves through the air , the air being a \u201cfluid\u201d.\nFor an undergrad in BME, the chemistry at Caltech, might be compelling, but I would say JHU, Caltech or GaTech are about the same for BME.   Maybe GaTech a tad better, IF the student wants to design prosthesis, the best artificial heart, etc, because GaTech has such a tight relationship with Emory U Medical and has arguably very good mechanical engineering training.\nAll BMEs are going to get more education. So its also a personal preference, does the student  want hot dry Pasadena, a small town, with great access to Los Angeles, or the big bustling city of Atlanta, with sports, hiking, rock climbing close by, or the sailing and crab cakes  that Baltimore offers, with access to Washington DC?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of South Carolina\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nFrom a pure opportunity standpoint, it\u2019s not even close.

What criteria did you give him/her when applying to schools in terms of what you were willing/able to contribute? What are her social/intellectual/academic wants and needs?\nYes, conventional CC wisdom will tell you to take the money from USC and run. But conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t always provide right answers in every case.\nMy daughter had to make the same choice last year: she was offered full tuition scholarships at USC, Vandy, and Wash U (and others) and had also gotten into HYPS and UChicago (UChicago gave a decent merit and FA combination; HYPS gave very little FA (under 10K) and, of course, no merit.\nThe most important criterion my D had was that she wanted to be around really, really bright kids. Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.\nUSC was not a good fit for my D, despite thinking that it had some interesting programs and seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her \u2013 she would NOT have been happy there). Among her full tuition scholarship options, she liked Wash U. the best.\nMy D, with our unwavering support, chose Stanford and could NOT be happier. To us, it is worth every penny.\nThat said, she is our only child, so we don\u2019t have any more tuitions to pay. We drive old cars and don\u2019t take lavish vacations. My D is not seeking an education as a means to an end \u2013 the only return on investment she seeks (and that we hope for her) is greater knowledge. She will likely end up in a PhD program in the humanities. She loves what she is studying, has had some absolutely amazing and supportive professors, enjoys her fellow students, and finally feels like she has intellectual peers (something she did not have in HS).\nShe has truly found her tribe there and is absolutely, positively 100% certain that she made the right choice.

It wasn\u2019t enough to dissuade him, but I remember talking about it. For me, it ended up being fantastic in ways I wouldn\u2019t have imagined.\nWhen the kids come home early Thanksgiving week, they are home until January. This meant a couple of things \u2026\nOne, there was no expensive, extra trip home two holidays in a row. You never know what the weather will be like in MN in November. We never had to worry whether those pricey tickets we bought were going to get eaten because he couldn\u2019t get out or back due to weather or that the trip was severely shortened because of delays and such. When he got home for turkey, he was home past New Year\u2019s. Ds2, who is at a faraway school on the semester system, has never come for Thanksgiving.\nTwo, that long break was so welcome. His first two years, he worked for his summer employer. They were thrilled to have him filling 25 hours/week during the busy holiday season. And he loved the extra money.  The third year he got home the week before Christmas because he was abroad. The fourth year he used that extra time to study for the GRE and took it the week before he flew back.\nThree, people seemed to think that doing study abroad would be difficult because of the trimesters. Well, if you are doing a Carleton program that\u2019s obviously not an issue. And kids, such as my ds, who do a non-Carleton program, just did it in the fall, when it\u2019s an even trade (one trimester/one semester). And, they miss some of that cold weather by not going to campus until spring.

Amherst appears on other lists, but not the physics list.  That\u2019s one data point, if you are looking at numeric data, but you also got a great anecdote from a poster here who majored in physics at Amherst, so individual experiences may vary.\nAs long as both physics programs look like they can match his needs and interests, he might weigh environmental factors of the school more heavily.\nCarleton has St. Olaf nearby, but Amherst shares a consortium with Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Hampshire, and U Mass Amherst. That increases the breadth of courses available to you. And that also means there are a lot of women around!\nThe open curriculum does not mean just that you can avoid subjects. It means that everyone in every class is there because they are truly interested in the subject. That has to influence class discussions.\nAmherst has seemingly limitless resources. Our tour guide said he was blown away by how much they can do for their students. He told us about how you can borrow a car and go to Boston or the White Mountains in NH or something, and Amherst even will reimburse the students for the gas.\nAs far as the athletic thing goes: as you pointed out, people say that about Williams too. I never played a sport at Williams. I never even went to a game a game at Williams. I am the least athletic person ever. And I was very happy socially and never felt excluded from anything in any way. You find like-minded friends wherever you go, I think. And Williams at least had a very friendly culture where people interacted across groups, maybe because of the freshman entry system mixing up everyone from the start. Our tour guide at Amherst this year wasn\u2019t an athlete, either, and he was African American, and a math/philosophy double major, and he was very happy at Amherst.\nI know Amherst better than Carleton, as someone who visited Amherst three times before picking Williams, my husband applied there too, and we have visited it recently with my son.

I had this conversation back then with him about USC scholarship vs Stanford.  I am an SC alum that\u2019s why :).  Told him if he got scholarship from SC he should go there (he is a science/math kid who loves to dance).  So that\u2019s our value.  Each family have their own values.\nWell things do not go as planned.  He decided he wanted to pursue dance (together with bio) so now USC dance program became his #1 choice. Like film school, it\u2019s extremely hard to get in.  He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super \u201cintellectual\u201d kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC\u2019s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.  We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.  Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWhether or not you become a billionaire has  VERY little (I would say nothing) to do with which college you attended\u2026\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@PT, if you told someone they \u201cwere not very intellectual,\u201d do you think they\u2019d take it as a compliment?\nI disagree with you that USC doesn\u2019t have a very intellectual student body, and I am sure OP would find plenty of intellectual classmates and faculty there.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Kenyon College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of California, San Diego\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nPhD should be funded (tuition waiver, living expense stipend, typically in exchange for teaching assistant or research assistant work).\nPsyD will be expensive.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWe can go back and forth but the practical reality is the vast majority of students accepted at both schools choose Duke unless driven to U Michigan be a financial imperative.

Cornell Arts & Sciences and Michigan Ross will be VERY different experiences academically. Ross is very preprofessional. It\u2019s almost like an employee training program with some academics sprinkled in. If you double major with math, which is in LSA, you actually would be doing a dual degree, meaning that you would be graduating with a BBA from Ross and a BA (or BS?) in math.\nAt Cornell Arts & Sciences you\u2019d be taking a more traditional course of study. It also has a lot of distribution requirements.  My recommendation is to make a spread sheet of the exact classes you\u2019d have to take (or requirements you\u2019d have to fulfill) every year at each college. Which looks more interesting? Which one gets you more excited? That will make the decision for you (outside of the financial aspect).\nOf course you can always go to Michigan and major in math there. You can minor in business at Ross if you want. There will be plenty of Wall St. opportunities with an undergrad math major.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Wisconsin-Madison\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nBut it would be kind of a shame to lose the opportunity to go to Yale, when there are tens of thousands of kids out there with Yale being their dream school, who aren\u2019t accepted and can never attend.

So NYU + MBA is definitely more expensive, and realistically the Wharton undergrad is more impressive than NYU + MBA in most cases. That said, I would probably just avoid the MBA altogether unless you feel financially comfortable and get into a top program.\nPenn is also a better school overall, so if you decide finance isn\u2019t for you then you\u2019re better positioned.

I don\u2019t think of Hamilton as being more creative than Bates. In fact, I am impressed with how strong the arts do seem to be at Bates. There\u2019s an actual Art museum on campus. But, you know my preferences, of course:-)\nBates is unquestionably liberal. I would not describe it as activist. My daughter likes that. There was a \u201cget out the vote\u201d effort during the election. I know people did attend the Women\u2019s March in various cities. But no, not activist. My D thought Hamilton was preppy and that was a reason she decided not to apply there. There are preppy kids at Bates too, but I would describe most of the stduent body as leaning a little more urban, or a little more outdoorsy, mixed with geeks, athletes, and hippies. (D\u2019s roommate is a total hippy.) Last year, Bates admitted 40 first-gen to college students. It works hard to increase diversity. That is one of the reasons why it went test-optional decades ago.\nGreat question about non-athletes, @hopeful1660 . D has found them, no problem. She has been with several groups of people from the start, and has now definitely found her people. None are athletes, though a couple of them are into ultimate Frisbee, which is apparently pretty popular. She seems to now have an ever-expanding group of non-athlete friends. The college puts on fairly regular campus-wide events and everyone comes and everyone enjoys them.\nThere is partying. Bates made Princeton Review\u2019s list again for Beer drinking. My D says she doesn\u2019t know why. She isn\u2019t a big partier, and though parties happen, it\u2019s not in your face. Or maybe she is hanging out with the wrong people! I seem to recall that she did say the lacrosse team has a lot of parties. Maybe the atheltes take the place of Greek Life?\nI am not sure about your concern for the reputation. I would say that Bates and Hamilton are both highly regarded. They have nearly identical acceptance rates. I cannot imagine that any employer would ever consider one better than the other. Bates has a very active alumni network. There are many internships and jobs offered by Bates alumni. The new president, Clayton Spencer, has raised over $120 million for the college in just four years. It has beautifully modernized buildings, and some gorgeous brand new dorms that are a thousand times nicer than the ones I saw at Hamilton, but perhaps Hamilton\u2019s dorms have been spruced up. There is, as far as I know, only one from that isn\u2019t gorgeous, but even it was given a facelift last summer. It at least has large rooms. I do not think Bates\u2019 endowment is an issue at all. Not sure if you have visited yet, but the campus and its buildings are beautiful.\nBates does have another big advantage, and that is its proximity to civilization. The college puts on free shuttles regularly to Freeport, which is a fun town with AMAZING shopping and restaurants. You will regularly run into kids from Bowdoin and Colby there. Also, free shuttles to Portland, which is a very cool small city. Once or twice a month, you can go to Boston for $20 for,the whole day. It\u2019s only two hours away. Lewsiton is a modest town, but there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance and the kids go out. The countryside is very beautiful there, and there is a lovely wide river where the rowing team practices. Next to campus is a bird sanctuary where kids run, and it appears, have bonfires.\nSo you can tell I think it\u2019s a great school. The retention rates between the two are very similar. You can\u2019t go wrong with either, but after reading what you are looking for, you seem like a Bobcat to me:-)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Columbia University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nColumbia and Michigan are not peer universities.

Doesn\u2019t matter what any ranking says, this is a deteriorating situation.\nAlexandre, do you deny this?\"\"\nCU123, many state universities are hurting, just as many private universities are hurting. But we are not discussing public universities on this thread. This thread is about Michigan. Michigan is not hurting. Financially, Michigan is doing very well. The University\u2019s endowment has at the fastest pace of any university in the nation between 1990 and today. In 1989, Michigan\u2019s endowment was not even among the top 30 in the nation. Today, it is the 8th largest. In 2009, in the midst of the financial meltdown, Michigan spent $100 million to buy Pfizer\u2019s global research HQ campus, made up of some 25 buildings and over 2 million square feet of lab space. Naturally, all universities save HYPS can use more money, and Michigan is no exception, but Michigan is very well off\u2026as well off as Columbia.\nTo address your question, yes, I deny this. According to its CDS, Michigan\u2019s student body in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has indeed increased from 33,481 in 2007 to 38,076 in 2016. But the size of its instructional faculty in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has also increased from 2,063 in 2007 to 2,583 in 2016. The student to faculty ratio has remained steady at 15:1. So yes, I deny it, and I have the facts to prove it.\nhttp://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2007-2008_umaa.pdf  (Section I2)\nhttp://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2016-2017_umaa.pdf (Section I2)\nBut tell me again, how do you justify Columbia\u2019s shameless claim that it has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when it omits 6,500 graduate students from its calculation? Oh, that\u2019s right, Columbia does not publish a CDS report. In fact, it is the only Ivy League institution that doesn\u2019t. But one thing is clear, Columbia is omitting 6,500 graduate students from its student to faculty ratio and that puts into serious question its ethical practices, as well a the integrity of the data it publishes. Columbia\u2019s actual student to faculty ratio would likely double if it were being honest, and its ratio would be 12:1 rather than 6:1. But that would mean a drop in the rankings, so obviously, Columbia and its private peers have little incentive to be honest. And what of the very flawed rankings methodology? Do you deny that private universities are gaming the rankings and that the methodology is seriously flawed?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIf you are worried about grade deflation and getting into med school.

Two both went to tippy top schools (with tippy top high school stats), and both ended up with GPA issues.  Ugh!\nAnother student also went to a top school, applied with a 3.5 gpa (borderline for unhooked trad) and she thankfully has nabbed an instate acceptance to an unranked SOM\u2026which is totally fine, but certainly wasn\u2019t in her original plan when she chose elite undergrad over midtier where she could have gone for nearly free.  Being from a lucky state helped her, I think.\n\n[quote]\nThere is a difference that my lad has seen once in med school. His undergrad classes (U Roc) seem to have prepared him very well for the coursework. He tells us many of his peers in med school are envious asking him how he already knows X. \u201cI learned it in undergrad.\u201d\nWhether that came from his college, major, or specific classes/profs that differed is impossible to tell, esp with anecdotal data.\nIn any case, in med school they teach you everything you need to know, so if one doesn\u2019t have a head start, they just have to put a little more time into learning it then. That\u2019s similar to some folks getting material in undergrad in a 201 or 301 course instead of 101. (I\u2019ve seen this happen via tests - what\u2019s covered in a higher level research school\u2019s 101 course for \u201ceveryone\u201d can be in a later course for majors at a different school.)\n[/quote]\n\nThis can be true.  I don\u2019t think my son encountered much of this but maybe because he was a STEM major?  I could see how a humanities major who only did the prereqs at a school where more difficult concepts are found in a 300 level course would be less-prepared.   But med schools seem to be fine with that as their goal is to teach everything in med school.\nOne newish trend that may end up backfiring is that more schools are moving to a 2 or 3 diadatic semesters, rather than the standard 4, I wonder how that\u2019s going to affect some students.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Northwestern University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rice University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI don\u2019t know much about Northwestern (other than its high level reputation), as I have never visited and neither of my kids applied.

And you can\u2019t work in the summer and much of the aid is loan based, if any.  Log onto the medical school sites to see the tution now.  Now, I firmly reject the advice that you should invariably go for the cheaper school, because the primary basis to reduce medical school costs is to get into a highly competitive low cost school (Baylor) or a free medical school (Case Western speciality school) or an MD Ph.D or merit money.  So, if you are choosing between Yale and Alabama, go to Yale.  Yale is far more likely to get you a low cost medical school.  But here, there is no discernible basis to think that Vanderbilt/Northwestern split, whatever it might be, would result in a better shot at merit money in medical school.  And both would give you a fighting shot at one of the low cost options.  I would absolutely bank the money from the CV scholarship to pay for over a third of medical school and if you are fortunate enought to get merit money or something similar, you might be able to go almost free.  Good luck.\nOne more point, I did not appreciate until recently how crazy medical school admissions and finances are, despite having ample reason to know.  Although you need to enjoy the college experience, going to medical school does require a four year plan, including knowing how you are going to get in (many admission rates are sub-5%, that is, as hard to get in as Harvard undergraduate) and how you are going to pay those big bucks.  It is worth logging onto the medical school websites to realize that they do count parental income, even for a 26 year old \u201cchild\u201d.  On the other hand, not to be too much of a pessimist, right now is an amazing time to be involved in medicine and the journey, well expensive and difficult is worth it if it is your dream.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Waitwhatss\nhttps://www.gafutures.org/hope-state-aid-programs/hope-zell-miller-scholarships/zell-miller-scholarship/maintaining-eligibility-for-the-zell-miller-scholarship/\nHere are the guidelines.

They both started their search investigating broad areas of concentration (biomedical and robotics engineering).  Their engineering parents held back our opinions but steered both to the conclusion that they needed to choose a traditional engineering discipline (mechanical, chemical, civil, electrical) and choosing an industry should be saved for a concentration or master\u2019s/PHD program.  Four years of depth; not just breath.   That process worked well; one chose Chemical and Biomolecular and the second Mechanical.\nWe all learned that both children needed to be in an environment that feeds their interests.  In the case of the ChemE, a campus with a medical school researching in partnership with the ChemE department and a strong Biomedical program.  In the case of the ME, an incredible robotics department, a robust ECE department (there are not may of these and GT is on top), flexibility to add not just CS but EE coursework to an ME curriculum, creating a concentration in systems.  For your interests, GT has it all with many research facilities.  My husband has been hiring for 20+ years.  His managers interview MIT, WPI, Cornell,GT students; it\u2019s really about the candidate not the particular school.  Our freshman is returning to New England to work in Pharma this summer.  Landing internships from afar can easily happen if you get research experience in college and actively pursue summer opportunities.\nOlin will be diverse but likely in the eclectic way that MA suburban charter high schools attract a type of student.  If that is not your type of happy home for 4 years, take the leap to Atlanta.  I understand the anxiety especially since most MA students do not leave New England because there are so many private schools.

Let\u2019s say you\u2019re at Nebraska and the state/local taxes are low-to-nil, so you\u2019re keeping about $130 of that per week. That comes to about $550 per month (since months average more than four full weeks).\nIf you adopted a \u201cspend half, save half\u201d mentality, you could:\n\nSpend an average of $65 per week. That could buy you five pizzas, or two pizzas and two movies, or two cheap dates, or one fancy date \u2013 every week. You could buy a soda now and then, chips, candy bar, whatever. Aside from adding some \u201cfun/food money\u201d to your college experience, it would also teach you how to plan and execute a budget, which is a valuable thing to learn. A lot of people don\u2019t know how to do that, go into credit card and other types of debt, and it causes major problems.\nSave an average of $65 per week. If you are on campus for 34 weeks out of the year, that\u2019s right around $2200 in savings. Or maybe you spend a little less or make a little more money, so you\u2019re saving $2500 per year. At graduation, you\u2019d have $10,000.\n\nThat $10,000 is $10,000 worth of access to opportunity and added security. It can help you put down a down payment on a house, it can come in handy if you are out of work for months, you can take a piece of it and do some traveling, etc.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Harvard University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI just noticed that OP also has UGA Foundation Fellows as an option.

It only shows that you have a choice of whether to pack what some other colleges do in a semester or not.   The 3 course sequence you mentioned includes 3-unit courses, so they are expected to cover less material than typical Stanford/Princeton math classes and contribute less than typical Stanford/Princeton classes towards graduation requirements.  Of course most Stanford students already took single variable calculus in HS.   The more typical higher level math sequences also seem to list more material in  their description for Stanford\u2019s 3 quarters than Princeton\u2019s 2 semesters.  For example Stanford\u2019s quarter length math 51-53 covers multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.  Princeton\u2019s math 201-202 covers multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but not explicitly differential equations.  However, they also may have the equivalent of more units to reflect the increased material.   It\u2019s not as simple as either 3 quarters of material at Stanford = 2 semesters of material elsewhere  or quarter != semester.  It depends on the class, number of units, and often falls somewhere in between those two extremes\u2026\nIf you want to have a general rule,  it\u2019s been my experience that 3 quarters at Stanford generally covers more material than 2 semesters elsewhere.  Quarter length classes did appear to be equivalent to semester length in some cases, but not all.    However, I haven\u2019t taken classes at Princeton or colleges at that academic level, besides Stanford\u2026\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Princeton University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@sherpa \u201cit\u2019s likely that few of his classmates knew he was an athlete, as he doesn\u2019t have a thick neck or have an \u201cA\u201d tattooed to his forehead.\u201d\nOmg too funny!  :))  Sorry if off topic but just had to say it  ;))\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: California Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIn 2018 about 39k students earned a 34-36 on the ACT.

The difference is driven primarily by liberal arts and pure sciences  admits who  would choose Yale much more, but Yale loses a big chunk of the engineering and business admits to Penn. It is precisely because it has an edge in these preprofessional areas than Penn is able to attract more cross-admits.  By comparison the split between Harvard vs Penn and Stanford vs Penn is 77% vs 23% and 72% vs 28% and is statistically significant. And this is because it cannot attract as many of these admits from Stanford and Harvard.\nWe are talking about engineering in general, op is not exactly set on bioengineering. but even for bioengineering, while the difference is not huge,  Penn is still  ranked higher and in combination with its stronger medical school and hospital and higher research funding in this field, it can be argued that it has an good edge.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Virginia\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@rugby1  the schools are pretty equivalent in terms of academic quality and standing.

Can\u2019t go wrong! Each is a little different, and take my impresions with a grain of salt as they are subjective of course. I think (overall) all three schools are pretty equal in your academic areas of interest- some might be stronger than others in certain areas but overall it\u2019s relative as all three are top notch schools.\nBates- wonderful community. Gorgeous (although small) campus/architecture. Very friendly vibe, students are welcoming and the close knit community feel is palpable. Strong academics, just a lovely school. Has the month long May plan which is useful for starting summer internships early or for traveling abroad. Major difference to me between it and the other two is a more laid back vibe. Doesn\u2019t feel as intense. Definitely collaborative. Best food of the three. Nephew is a current student. D15 would have applied regular decision if her ED school had fallen through. Bates is very high on D18\u2019s list this year.\nBowdoin- neat school. Lovely campus in it\u2019s own quirky way. Location near Portland is nice, it is more suburban than rural if that matters to you. Great if you like the ocean. Pretty far away from mountains though if you like having them in your back yard. Of course great academics. Personally, I sensed a little more academic elitism at Bowdoin than the other three. I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, and perhaps I have used the wrong word. Just seemed a little bit more academcially snobby than the other two. Not sure how collaborative/competitive, don\u2019t know enough kids who go there.  D15 liked Bowdoin a lot, would have applied if her ED school fell through. D18 didn\u2019t even look at Bowdoin, too intense of a school for her.\nMiddlebury- awesome location in the mountains, lovely campus. Feels considerably bigger than the other two schools. D15 went ED and attends. Loving her expereince, it is the right mix of academic intensity and fun for her. Raves about (most) of the professors/classes she has taken. Has found Midd more collaborative than competitive (she is env policy major). Heavily involved in the Mountain Club. Knows women on the cross country/track team and they are a great group. Jan Plan is very popular- fun to have the one block class in the middle of ski season. Lots of students ski. D18 not interested in Midd, a bit too intense for her.\nGood luck!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pittsburgh\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@mom2collegekids  - I think we discussed this on another thread, but Vandy\u2019s acceptance rate and med school placement in terms of total number of kids accepted was low compared to its peer private universities. This is especially surprising since Vandy places significant emphasis on test scores on the undergraduate level and these kids should score well on the MCAT. The fact that other similarly ranked private schools have more kids enrolled in med school leads me to believe something is off about Vandy\u2019s pre-med program. To spend $200,000 on tuition one would expect a higher placement rate than 66 percent especially since most of Vandy\u2019s pre-med\u2019s would have qualified for AU\u2019s free tuition and 55 percent placement rate.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: New York University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAnother way to view OP\u2019s situation is through a best case/ worst case analysis.

Are there courses or programs that seem more appealing at one versus the other?  Brown offers an Open Curriculum, which gives students a lot of choice, but is that something that your son would take advantage of?

In addition, Bates has a long association with the African-American community, and goes to great lengths to recruit first-gen students. Along with being one of the first test-optional schools, it\u2019s probably fair to say that all those groups were not traditionally associated with high-paying careers. It\u2019s not so much the case now, of course.\nThis is from a NY Times 2015 article, discussing a study on the effect of test scores on GPA:\nThe study \u201cfound no significant difference between nonsubmitters and submitters in graduation rates (0.6 percent lower for nonsubmitters) or cumulative G.P.A. (2.83 for nonsubmitters, 2.88 with test scores).\u201d Furthermore,\n\u201cData also showed that nonsubmitters are more likely than submitters to be first-generation-to-college enrollees, underrepresented minorities, women, Pell Grant recipients and students with learning differences.\u201d Again, traditionally groups of people that would be expected to earn less. Yet, it\u2019s apparent that educational quality is not suffering.\nI wasn\u2019t going to make this long, however, I had to look. Bates and Hamilton have both produced 5 Rhodes Scholars. Yet, Bates is #5 in Fulbright Scholars, whereas Hamilton is #15. So it\u2019s pretty clear that Bates is not a sub-par educational institution. It\u2019s also clear that its student body might not typically be from as high-earning a background as Hamilton, which affects endowments, which affects USNWR rankings. Bates has a now-long history of being test-optional, whereas Hamilton does not, though it has modified its test requirements over the years.\nRe the distribution requirements, that is something my D has found surprising. The requirements are soooo loose. D was given full credit for four of her AP classes. So she has already met some of the requirements, and said to me when choosing her courses for next year, that it feels like there are no requirements. She pretty much is just taking classes she is interested in.\nAt any rate, the whole rankings thing is clearly misleading, and a different thread. A different publication\u2019s ranking will tell a different story. Anyway, OP, good luck with your decision. Either school is a great choice.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Richmond\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Haverford College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI am a Haverford student and I have a number of friends from Haverford who have taken Wharton classes.

That experience is probably different from that of most students at Stanford, but it\u2019s limited to 90 students a year.  Also, because they live in a separate dorm, they are somewhat isolated from other students, and I don\u2019t think I ever interacted with anyone from SLE.\nWhen I attended, students were required to take a year-long course in Western Civilization, which was intended to be equivalent to the Great Books curriculum at UChicago and Columbia, and which was supposed to stimulate common discussion among students on a shared reading list.  But we had 9 or so different tracks for Western Civ, each sponsored by a different department, such as history or science and technology, so we never really all read the same set of books.  Anyway, Stanford eliminated its Western Civ requirement 30 years ago, due in part to student pressure, so aside from SLE, there hasn\u2019t been a common core experience at Stanford in a long time.\nStanford has long had a cultural divide between those who major in STEM subjects and those who major in the humanities and social sciences.  Back then, they called each other \u201ctechies\u201d and \u201cfuzzies\u201d, and apparently, those terms are still in use today.

Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley.\nI think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn\u2019t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates.\nBut these were our impressions. Hopefully others can give you theirs too so you can get a better feel about if there\u2019s a consistent theme.   Good luck, and you really can\u2019t go wrong. Once you choose, don\u2019t look back, only look forward.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Southern Methodist University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIn the US, staying in state to attend a public university is often financially advantageous.

If you\u2019re interested in participating in research, Pomona will provide extraordinary opportunities, and you will be able to work directly with faculty. You might take a look at the faculty bios in your departments of interest to see what you think of the people you\u2019ll be interacting with. If you\u2019re an ideas person who likes to ask and answer questions and be challenged to develop your own theories, Pomona is a good fit. If you feel comfortable with, and are invigorated by the idea of developing a personal rapport with esteemed faculty, Pomona is a good fit. I still visit with my favorite faculty mentor over 20 years later. The cross-registration is indeed a cool feature of the Claremonts. Each school does have its personality and reputation behind it, but all the schools are strong, selective, and well-resourced, so it\u2019s a powerhouse there. There\u2019s one central main library for all the schools, one campus ministry center, one student health/counseling center, one main bookstore, one student newspaper.\nHave you visited Claremont? It\u2019s very suburban and not particularly stimulating. You can easily walk to the adjacent \u201cVillage\u201d which has a movie theater, coffee shops, and restaurants, and it\u2019s cute and pleasant but nothing that\u2019s really going to ignite any curiosity or provide a lot of opportunities. The surrounding suburbs are even more ho-hum. So there\u2019s really nothing particularly advantageous about the environs there other than it\u2019s a convenient climate that doesn\u2019t impact your life much except for some days in the fall when you will wish you had air conditioning. But if you don\u2019t love Baltimore, then that\u2019s not a real factor I suppose. In my era, Pomona was relatively weak on career development and tended to send many students to either graduate school for PhDs/academia or med school, and the main supported direct placement into full-time jobs was the management consulting route. There were pockets of weak departments and some use of questionable part-time faculty for classes like calculus \u2013 but that\u2019s old data so not worth much. All the Claremont schools talk about internship opportunities but be aware that \u201cLos Angeles\u201d is a solid hour by train from Claremont, so this resource has some challenges built in. Pomona places a strong emphasis on diversity and most of the community there are students of color. In that, it feels very similar to southern California as a whole, where there\u2019s no one racial majority.\nIt\u2019s the most selective liberal arts college in the nation with a huge endowment. Still, most everyday people on the street will not have heard of it, so if you want that nod of recognition when making small talk, Pomona isn\u2019t the one. Having said all these things, I\u2019d choose Pomona again based primarily on one key principle: it\u2019s devoted to undergraduates. I think it makes sense to attend the school that is all about undergrads when an undergrad, then attend a grad school where grad students are a priority. In all, you\u2019re in a great and enviable position \u2013 congratulations and good luck!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Columbia University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@payubisoft1\n\n[quote]\nI know that Michigan has the slightly higher CS rating, but I feel like there would be more opportunities in NYC?\n[/quote]\n\nYou will be able to get a job in any city after graduation with a degree from either, and recruiters from all the big companies will be on campus.

Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s campuses are unbelievably large and growing larger by the minute in the towns surrounding Palo Alto (Mountain View and Menlo Park).\nYesterday, while watching the Eagles-49ers (in Philly) game, and then little bit of the Washington-Dallas (near DC) football games, it was raining hard. I went for a run in my shorts and tank and enjoyed a cup of coffee in my backyard.  \nWhat a wonderful decision you have in front of you. Both outstanding schools and campuses.

Most feshmen did single variable calculus in HS and take  more advanced  math sequences that go at a faster pace.  A partial summary of freshmen math options is below.  Note that there a variety of different options for students with different math background/ability/interests, as well as students who are looking to cover the material more rigorously, rather than offering a single level for all students.

MBA salaries are equal for the same job no matter which school you go to \u2014 i.e., MBB will pay $140k base regardless of the MBA program they are hiring out of.

Shaw, Drop Box, Palantir, etc.\nI think the better job depends on many factors: the specific duties, compensation, location, etc.\"\"\nMuch2learn, I agree that other companies may offer more appealing alternatives, although I am not sure that those companies are hiring any fewer Michigan graduates vis-a-vis graduates from other top universities. For example, Michigan grads still do better with some of those secondary companies you mentioned, including Facebook, which hired more Michigan grads (12) than Cornell (fewer than 5) and Penn (2).\nLocation, as you point our, plays a major role here. That is why many graduates end up working in their respective regions. It is difficult for many graduates from schools like Michigan and Northwestern to accept jobs on the West Coast or East Cost because that would mean going far from home. Many would rather take good jobs locally, or regionally.\nThat being said, I do not think the pay gap is sufficient to make any assumptions or draw any conclusions. The Michigan average starting pay for a CS major is $94,000, vs $101,000 for a Penn CS major. That $7k gap could well be explained by a variety of reasons/factors, including regional pay differences and relative differences in variable pay (stock options etc\u2026).\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Vanderbilt University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Northwestern University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIf she loves both I\u2019d go with Vandy.

However, the price is rather expensive if the intention is to transfer to PSU Main, using PSU Erie like a community college.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nThis is just my opinion, but I bet she\u2019d be very happy at VT.

I believe the answer is maybe in very few scenarios such as for investment banking and consulting and by firms such as Goldman Sachs and McKinsey which target a few schools for recruiting. A\nnd maybe one can argue that Stanford\u2019s proximity to Silicon Valley\u2019s ecosystem would confer some advantage for graduates interested in tech start-ups. Yes, high tech firms recruit all over the country, but the informal ways to connect with venture capitalists, founders, etc. is undeniably richer in Silicon Valley.\nAlso, in some rare situations where the employer is a foreign country-backed (particularly China) organization looking for employees with internationally prestigious education credentials, Harvard and Stanford would offer an advantage by virtue of their reputation internationally.\nThese are all very rare situations.\nFor the majority of career fields, no there would not be meaningful difference.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Amateurengineer You are welcome.

The open curriculum allowed me to follow my career interests while taking advantage of the greatest resource the school has to offer\u2026its teachers.\n[/quote]\n\nYou\u2019re giving the open curriculum too much credit here.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 it\u2019s great that a STEM major takes lots of cool non-STEM classes. This is, in fact, the LAC ideal. But the exact same thing would have been possible at a LAC with distribution requirements, e.g. Carleton or Williams or Swarthmore. The point of distribution requirements is simply to guarantee that a STEM major takes non-STEM classes.\nSo you could have been a STEM major and taken lots of cool non-STEM courses at any of these schools. The only difference is that Amherst allowed you to take cool non-STEM courses on a voluntary basis, while at the other schools, taking cool non-STEM courses would have been required. But the net result (for you) would have been exactly the same.\nIf you plan to explore a wide variety of disciplines during your LAC career, then it makes no difference whether you pick a school with an open curriculum or one with distribution requirements. If there are distribution requirements, you will fulfill them without even trying.\nThe open curriculum matters for people who want to limit their explorations. For example, if you were a STEM major and you wanted to avoid taking non-STEM courses, then it would make a big difference if you enrolled at Amherst vs. the other schools.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Harvard University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYou can only borrow 5500.   6500 7500 7500 undergrad max.

BU is more urban and appeals to a more independent student (not just because it is urban but because it is so large: 32K students vs. BC\u2019s 14K).\nI was surprised to learn, however, that both schools have high percentages of students that live on campus: 75% for BU and 82% for BC.  I would have guessed that a lot of BU students would not live on campus.  I was wrong.  I\u2019m also guessing that at both schools a fair number of upperclassmen (seniors especially perhaps) choose to live away from school.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nDo attend the special overnight visit and stay.

Over 200 Michigan undergrads are admitted into Michigan\u2019s top ranked graduate professional programs annually, and many more are admitted into other top graduate programs around the nation. When it comes to professional placement, there are plenty of reports that show that Michigan is very well recruited. Columbia does not publish placement data, but Penn does. Last year, 36 Michigan engineering/CS graduates were hired by Google, compared to 19 Penn engineering/CS graduates. Another 33 Michigan engineering and CS graduates were hired by Apple compared to just 3 Penn engineering/CS graduates. 41 Michigan engineering/CS majors were hired by Microsoft, compared to 10 Penn engineering/CS graduates. 49 Michigan engineering/CS majors were hired by Amazon, compared to 6 Penn engineering/CS majors. In total, 149 Michigan engineering/CS graduates were hired by those four Tech giants, compared to 38 Penn engineering/CS graduates. I am not sure what more proof you want that Michigan does just as well as schools like Columbia and Penn when it comes to placement.\nBut like I said, there are several sources that seem to think that Michigan holds its own, at least with tech firms are concerned:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/schools-with-the-most-alumni-at-google-2015-10\nhttps://qz.com/967985/silicon-valley-companies-like-apple-aapl-hires-the-most-alumni-of-these-10-universities-and-none-of-them-are-in-the-ivy-league/\nhttps://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2017/04/27/top-feeder-schools-silicon-valley/\n\u201cU of M receives limited state money and has to take most of its undergrads from the state of Michigan. Making matters worse, the State of Michigan\u2019s public education is in a death spiral which is making qualified in-state candidates scarce (see link below).\u201d\nFirst of all, the University of Michigan no longer takes most of its undergraduate students from the state of Michigan. Last Freshman class was roughly 50% OOS. Secondly, while many public high schools in Michigan are not doing well, the ones that feed into Michigan are doing just fine. Second, Michigan receives $300 million from the state annually. While that is by no means enough on its own, when you combined it with its considerable endowment and the money Michigan generates from tuition thanks to its large OOS student body, the University is perfectly fine.\n\u201cHistorically, U of M\u2019s advantages are their strong alumni base, its large endowment, and sports. However, sports seems to be sliding with the football team losing 12 out of the last 13 games to Ohio State and 8 out of the last 10 games to Michigan State.\u201d\nWhat does football have to do with anything? Michigan is, first and foremost, one of the most intellectually supercharged communities in the country. Both Ann Arbor (which has the highest percentage of college education residents than any city in the US) and the University have an incredibly vibrant intellectual feel. Michigan is known for that. Michigan is also known for its very well rounded academic excellence. In fact, it is arguably the most well rounded academic institution in the country. Michigan is ranked among the top 15 in virtually every single field of study, and among the top 10 in most, including Business, Law and Medicine, as well as most traditional disciplines, such as English, History and Mathematics. In Anthropology, the Classics, Engineering, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology and Sociology, Michigan is among the top 5 nationally. Michigan is also known as a medical center, and its hospital is considered one of the top 10 in the nation. So to suggest that Michigan is mostly known for football is a crude statement. That may be true of the uneducated masses, but then again, in those circles, most universities are not even recognized. But if you are insinuating that\u2019s Michigan\u2019s alumni are only loyal to the University if the football program is winning, you are mistaken. Michigan raised more from its alumni this year than it ever has. Michigan alumni are loyal to the university regardless of its football record.\nBut putting its record vs OSU and MSU aside, which is difficult considering how lopsided it has been, Michigan football is still doing well. It had back to back 10-3 seasons in 2015 and 2016, finishing #11 in the nation in 2015 and #10 in 2016. In 2015, two of Michigan\u2019s three losses were by 7 points or less, and they beat Florida 41-7 at the Citrus Bow. In 2016, Michigan lost 13-14 at Iowa, 27-30 in double overtime at OSU and 32-33 against Florida State at the Orange Bowl. 9 of Michigan\u2019s 10 wins in 2016 were by 9 points or more This year was supposed to be a rebuilding year, with 11 players drafted by the NFL last year. Still, the team is 4-1 (including a 33-17 win against Florida) and ranked #17 in the nation. Its four wins were all by a 16 point margin or better. While Michigan is struggling on offense this year, the Defense is ranked #1 in the nation. Another 10-3, top 10 season is certainly possible. Michigan also recruited back to back top 10 classes. I would say the future of Michigan football is looking good.\n\u201cGiven their situation, I don\u2019t see how they can improve their undergrad situation significantly unless the State allows them to go private, which I think is unlikely.\u201d\nMichigan\u2019s situation is good. The University is in very high demand as is evidenced by the annual increase in its applicant pool and 45% yield rate despite not enjoying the benefits of Early Decision admissions. Its endowment is one of the largest and growing by a healthy margin. The alumni are very loyal. Ann Arbor is a very nice college town.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nOK, @Center, and I\u2019ve gotta ask what your background is as well.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@muchtolearn While Penn State overall may not be in the same league as Penn its harder to get into Schreyer than Penn.

I don\u2019t see why spending 20+ hours per week of athletic practice in a sport shouldn\u2019t give you at least as much credit as a PE class.  However,  rowing is only a ~1 credit class like PE classes, and most rowers were not eligible at the time I was on the team.  The ~1 credit is little in comparison to the 180 credits required to graduate, and does not at all reflect the many hours of practice and commitment that is required to be on the team.

They don\u2019t like the loss of control of their offspring and they don\u2019t like the competition for resources within the institution.

Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).

So Bates had a good 100-year head start on coeducation. Unfortunately, women didn\u2019t generally have great career opportunities or earning power during the late 1800s and early 1900s.

It can really affect how well they do even at the high school level.  I combat that all the time with students who were slower to develop math skills thinking they must be \u201cdumb\u201d and not even trying.  I see it as an end result with adults who go back for a degree later in life terrified of math, take Alg, and wonder \u201cwhy couldn\u2019t I get that in high school?\u201d\nFor med school only GPA matters (not rigor) for academics, so if a student thinks they can do well, they usually do.\nThere is a difference that my lad has seen once in med school.  His undergrad classes (U Roc) seem to have prepared him very well for the coursework.  He tells us many of his peers in med school are envious asking him how he already knows X.  \u201cI learned it in undergrad.\u201d  Whether that came from his college, major, or specific classes/profs that differed is impossible to tell, esp with anecdotal data.  In any case, in med school they teach you everything you need to know, so if one doesn\u2019t have a head start, they just have to put a little more time into learning it then.  That\u2019s similar to some folks getting material in undergrad in a 201 or 301 course instead of 101.  (I\u2019ve seen this happen via tests - what\u2019s covered in a higher level research school\u2019s 101 course for \u201ceveryone\u201d can be in a later course for majors at a different school.)\nWhen kids from my school are hoping to go to med school and ask for my advice it\u2019s simple.  Look for an affordable school you like where you\u2019re in the Top 25% of entering stats, read U Roc\u2019s School of Medicine Class Profile for a few years (changing the URL to get more years), then work to become a student they like on your application.

Usually courses that lean more on reasoning and analytical problem solving cause even the highest SAT/ACT scorers trouble because it isn\u2019t enough to simply know the content or knowing every problem type you\u2019ve been exposed to while studying.  Usually such instructors get the \u201ctests us on stuff we didn\u2019t learn\u201d reputation.  To me this is code for: \u201cThis instructor surprises students and makes them think about what they learned in a seemingly unfamiliar context or maybe even requires some creativity\u201d.  Most students, including high achievers seem really comfy with neat and predictable and as an educator, you probably know what that may entail in a college classroom or any classroom.\nI\u2019ve met many students (I am among them) who are comfortable with courses that involve more conceptual logic and reasoning, but it seems like the vast majority prefer what I described earlier and that makes sense because it is how many of us were trained prior to college (heavily coached and spoonfed material and told exactly what was on a test and how it would be tested).  There is a reason so many students find organic chemistry, for example, an oddball.  Forget it if you integrate lots of reasoning into biology courses.  Unless they are a majority of the bio curric.,at a school, said courses will be avoided like the plague because that isn\u2019t how most people\u2019s biology courses went in high school (they were often just content overload).  I guess I just paint \u201cchallenging\u201d as whatever forces most students out of their comfort zone or upsets previous ways of obtaining knowledge/studying.  For most it would be STEM courses with less memorization or with instructors who throw critical thinking oriented \u201ccurveballs\u201d as many call it.  It\u2019s why I always relate the two (difficulty and style of assessment and course delivery).  My opinion is that every STEM major should graduate knowing how to use the knowledge or at least understand reasoning in the field, and yes most will enter college with different readiness levels to make that adjustment. You\u2019ll notice that at selective schools, the courses that mostly assess basic understanding and remembering/identifying have 85+ course averages.  One has to go to higher levels of Bloom to get 70 and 60 averages.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rutgers University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Creekland  The statement above  does not capitalize \u201cprofessional engineer\u201d or specifically reference PE status (my husband has his PE license  as well, although did not go to Virginia Tech).

She might be able to get some great job for a year or two in one of their many specialty clinics while she studies for her MCATs and applies to med schools.\nThe thought of my child being saddled with the cost of medical school at over 350K (not including the add\u2019l deferred interest costs if she choose to specialize in a field requiring many additional years of commitment) is not just concerning but flat out nauseating.\nOne other factor, if she is the recipient of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship, that is a feather in her cap for future admissions to graduate/medical school.\nSo, I would counsel my daughter simply: \"\" if you got, use it!\"\".  In other words, take the darn scholarship!\nWhat are we missing?

Could be either school or both.\nI would spend some time looking through the course catalog. I\u2019ve found big differences between LACs on course offerings.

She ultimately ended up choosing University of Maryland since they had given her a full ride and she knew she wanted to continue her studies in grad school when she finished undergrad and didn\u2019t want a huge amount of debt.  Each of the 3 programs are very strong and each campus has their strengths. Your son should try to choose where he feels will be the best fit for him not only academically but socially too.  When your son visits I suggest he also tries to sit in on a class or 2 to see what the academics are like.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pomona College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nNo, but a lot of my close friends are, and I\u2019m part of the Facebook CS community. I was a science major in another department, so I can speak about research at Pomona.\nIt\u2019s easy to get involved- you can start from the moment you arrive on campus! I started in the second semester of my first year. The intro courses do a good job connecting you with the department so you can learn about each professor\u2019s research interests and see where you want to build experience. You mentioned an interest in AI, so here\u2019s a perspective from a recent grad to see her CS experiences both in and outside Pomona: http://www.pomona.edu/news/2018/03/22-chinasa-okolo-%E2%80%9918-coding-more-inclusive-computer-science\nDuring the school year, you do research as a course- in your case, either CS199RAPO (Research Assistantship) or CS199IRPO (Independent Research). I believe there are some funds available for students who need work-study money as well. These are courses you create which are advised by a professor. Grad schools love these because it shows independence and direct research involvement. There\u2019s also a game lab at CGU: http://www.cgu.edu/center/claremont-game-lab/\nMost upper-division labs at Pomona are structured to involve an independent research project. The work I did in two of my labs (required courses at Pomona!) was presented in research conferences, and one was turned into a paper.\nDuring the summer, there are three opportunities you can use. Summer Undergrad Research Program, SURP, pays $440 per week and funds about ~200 students to engage with research with professors on-campus. An additional 30-50 projects are funded for off-campus unpaid research opportunities or independent proposals. Pomona College Summer Experience Funding (SEF) is done through the Career Development Office and funds unpaid or low-paying internships (you come up with the budget); I benefited from that to do research at a major university. Harvey Mudd sponsors a 5C summer research program in CS which sponsors 70 students for research: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/research/ This isn\u2019t as difficult to benefit from as it sounds, since the vast majority of CS students across the colleges do an internship over the summer rather than staying on campus.\nThesis is optional for CS at Pomona, but highly encouraged if you want to go to grad school. You can do an academic thesis (with independent research) advised by a CS professor at either Pomona or Mudd- there\u2019s an agreement between the two schools to combine professor expertise in order to manage thesis led research proposals. As seen above, Chinasa did her senior project with a Pomona professor. The alternative is Clinic, in which you are given an industry project by a company and work in teams to come up with solutions/insights. You can learn more about Clinic here (http://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/info) and see specific projects here (https://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/projects/).

Those kiddos almost all get PhDs.\nCaltech is a school of geniuses and a few drop outs and a few that commit suicide as they cannot keep up.\u201d\nThis does not mean they will all be good engineers. In fact, when my son was looking, one of my patients (the manager of one of NASA\u2019s most famous programs, dual PhD in Physics and Math, and Caltech prof) told me that some of the Caltech engineers he hired for that program were pretty pedestrian and that some of his best engineers were from Podunk U. Just because they teach brutally fast does not mean they are good at teaching students the art of solving practical engineering problems. Two retired Caltech profs told him that if his goal was to be a practicing engineer, not to consider Caltech.\nLooking at JPLs Executive Council members with tech rolls (non-HR, etc.), none were educated at Caltech. Their schools in no particular order, representing both undergrad and graduate degrees are: Texas A&M, Sam Houston State, Cal Poly, Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, Texas, MIT, Colorado, Washington, Toronto, USC and Purdue.\nEngineering is VERY egalitarian.

Biomedical engineering at Yale it is a small program, but builds on its world leading Biology, Medicine and Chemistry departments, which are all top 10-12 in the world, and the research by faculty is cutting edge. (Check out Mark Saltzmann and Andre Levchenko\u2019s research, as well the the Yale West Campus among other things). I presume Biomedical Engineering at Penn isn\u2019t an option for you, but the curriculum requirements are broadly similar anyway.\nIf you\u2019re interested in entrepreneurship, Wharton definitely has a much larger group of people with like minded interests, but Yale also sees its fair share of startups. The Yale Entrepreneurial Institute gives out tons of money each year and there are lots of companies that start off as collaborations between undergraduates, medical school, law school and business school students.\nIf you want to be the best engineer, I would suggest Yale even though Penn might have a larger engineering program, because the Jerome Fisher program has a huge number of requirements that are economics/finance based. At Yale you could devote that time to engineering/math/science courses instead if you wish.\nThe campus culture at both schools is mostly defined by the mix of majors. At Yale more students tend to be involved in the arts and government as well as public service. At Penn, you\u2019ll find more students interested in finance, business, etc. There will be lots of science geeks at both places at well. Lastly, Penn has a much larger number of students (24,000+) vs Yale (12,000), and Yale also has a residential college program, which might mean a smaller, more intimate atmosphere for undergrads.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bowdoin College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Middlebury College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nBowdoin owns a nature reserve island.

He did an internship at Google in Ann Arbor (yes Google is in Ann Arbor) and was offered employment once he graduated. He was super driven and he did a few abroad studies in Spain, Denmark, and I believe even in Brazil. The school IB department is fabulous and competitive. Having said that, his only REGRET was that he did not go to a higher ranked or overall better named school . The overall Business School is good but not like the IB department and not as selective. At the time he was applying to colleges,USC was the most affordable option and that is where he ended up going. He knows that the fact that he graduated for USC did NOT affect internship or job opportunities.

It seems to me it doesn\u2019t matter that UF sends a lot of kids to medical school for this analysis.  UF is much bigger and sends a smaller percentage.  And a smaller percentage to to top schools.  And I can see a path to going state school if you state medical school is cheap, and that is where you want to go, and the flagship sends a lot of kids.  So, UT austin on a full ride might lead you right to a cheap, but top, texas medical school.  Then your total debt might be minimal.  But that is not the case here unless the plan is to go to a georgia State medical school.  And, even then, I venture, going to harvard would likely result in merit money.  My point overall is that it is way to simplistic, if medical school is in the cards, not to even consider how it will play out with the next, larger, expenditure of 400,000 and the 3% admission rates.  I believe that you are far more likely to get in, and get merit money, coming from Harvard.  In that case, the debt is worth it.  I would say, at a mininum, nobody should simply assume that you can get the same output (cheap medical school), from a different input (GT v.Harvard but should at least look at the cost and stats from each school for medical school.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Southern Methodist University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nDo you think your daughter would be happier at a smaller school with smaller classes?

She had some good choices, like your daughter, and I didn\u2019t think SMU was going to make the top 3.  After final visits to the other choices - and none of them feeling quite right - she made a trip to SMU by herself for an admitted student weekend.  Within the first few hours, she knew she had found her place.  She works hard at her studies (she is an engineering major) but has had the time and opportunity to be involved with a few campus organizations.  Because she has been involved and met lots of different people, she has had a very good experience so far.  Sounds like your daughter has some great options.  Obviously there were more highly ranked options for engineering schools but we weren\u2019t entirely sure she would enjoy engineering and hoped she would choose a school with lots of other options if she decided to change majors.  Rankings are important, I guess, but we didn\u2019t really care all that much.  Factors like travel distance (she\u2019s 1000 miles away but a short, relatively inexpensive direct flight), job / internship opportunities in large city (Dallas), active campus ministry (we are Catholic), affordability with merit scholarships, and a small, supportive engineering program played into her decision more than any ranking.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rutgers University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nSpent a few minutes looking at VT\u2019s website about engineering and saw this statement:\n\n[quote]\nVirginia Tech produces a fifth of the nation\u2019s professional engineers.\n[/quote]\n\nHave to admit I\u2019m stunned.

You might find an easier or tougher Prof at either one of them TBH (or any other school), but both have their reputation due in part to the reputation for their academics and research.  Both schools have students who successfully get into med school each year.  Both schools have those who don\u2019t.  Whether those who don\u2019t could have if they\u2019d made a different choice is debatable. Statistics never apply to the individual.\nFTR, my pp to you wasn\u2019t meant to be condemnation.  It was meant to get you to seriously look at your presentation, because that matters.  Tact matters in several aspects of life.\nFrom those I\u2019ve seen from the high school I work at, the students who are most successful at getting admitted to med school are those who select a school where they are in the Top 25% of incoming students (unless at a lottery school where \u201call\u201d are really at that level with a point or two here or there being meaningless).  They also have a good work ethic from high school and don\u2019t suddenly arrive at college freshmen year changing their major (or minor) to \u201cparty.\u201d  They join things and have fun, but remember to put studying and truly learning the material as their top focus.  They ask questions when they don\u2019t understand something.\nMy theory as to why they do better when they are in the Top 25% (GPA and SAT/ACT) is confidence level.  Those stats tend to show a similar foundation of academics.  Many classes in college start at the \u201caverage\u201d level for incoming students.  When students get into a class where they\u2019re \u201cbehind\u201d others they tend to feel they are \u201cdumb\u201d compared to the class.  That\u2019s not necessarily true as it\u2019s often a foundation gap they could fill in, but they think it is and get stressed/discouraged.  When they feel \u201cup\u201d with their peers, or on the higher end, it\u2019s a good boost to confidence letting them feel they can continue to take on anything/everything.  It\u2019s a theory (hypothesis if I want to get technical), so take it as you wish.  If you aren\u2019t in the Top 25% for either school, you might want to consider others - or know you could have to work a little bit more at the beginning to close an occasional gap or two in the introductory classes (and that\u2019s ok - you just have to actually do it).\nBest wishes to you no matter where you ultimately choose.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting a medical career.  You don\u2019t want to give yourself more hurdles by not understanding the whole process.  How you come across at each stage is part of that process.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Columbia University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\u201cColumbia is a totally different environment and a great school, but if it is better than Michigan, it isn\u2019t six-figures better.\u201d\nOMG.

Otherwise both schools are a reach for just about anyone. Of course, once he\u2019s admmitted and given the swimming thing a fair effort (say, for one year) he could quit.\nI would just advise the OP that a promise of support from Coach Nichols at Amherst is worth a heck of a lot more than a promise of support at HM. As you point out, Nichols gets his guys admitted. HM and the other Claremont McKenna colleges have a reputation for over-promising to prospective athletes on occasion \u2014 the process of athletic support has been in place much longer and is more established in the NESCAC. And, of the five schools in the consortium, Harvey Mudd is the one LEAST interested in sports and in supporting athletes at admission. If you were truly driven to study Engineering, then I\u2019d encourage you to assume a bit more risk and apply ED to Harvey Mudd. But given your ambivalence, I think you have to factor in the difference in coach support between the two schools (and more generally between the NESCACs and the five colleges of the consortium) and go with the bird-in-the-hand, Amherst. I\u2019d hate to see you lose the nearly certain ED admission at Amherst and then fail to secure admission at HM. After the ED round, you\u2019d be SOL at Amherst. Coach support in the NESCAC works only in the ED round.\nIf you do decide to apply ED at HM, I\u2019d encourage you to line up support for EDII. Middlebury could help you there. And you\u2019d really like Coach Rueppel.\nGood luck!\np.s.

However, I also think that there are significantly more \u201cscience-phobes\u201d and \u201cmath-phobes\u201d out there than \u201csocial science-phobes\u201d or \u201chumanities-phobes\u201d.\nAmherst\u2019s own data bear this out. The following numbers are from the Amherst Class of 2011, and were compiled for a 2013 accreditation review. For comparison, let\u2019s use \u201c3+ classes per academic division\u201d as a benchmark, because it is a common LAC distribution requirement (as at, for example, Williams):\nHumanities Division: 8% did not meet the benchmark (i.e. took fewer than 3 classes in this division). 1% took zero classes.\nSocial & Behavioral Sciences Division: 10% did not meet the benchmark. 2% took zero classes.\nScience & Math: 43% did not meet the benchmark. 14% took zero classes.\nIt\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that many Amherst students use the open curriculum as a way to avoid science and math. Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many.\nAnother way to look at it: 92% of the Amherst Class of 2011 would have satisfied commonly used distribution requirements for humanities, and 91% would have done so in social sciences. But only 57% would have done so in science and math.\nhttps://www.amherst.edu/system/files/AC_NEASC_5_Year_Report_2013_0.pdf\n(Table: Class of 2011 Courses Attempted by Division, on p. 52).\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nDoes that make it your least expensive option then?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Northwestern University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rice University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nTwo terrific universities which are reputationally relatively similar!

I have a kid at an Ivy in a different sport. From California as well and wanted a different culture.  It\u2019s working out ok for him there and the deciding factor was the major, school culture, the team competitiveness and team culture. One thing to seriously consider is the weather especially given that yours is an outdoor sport. My kid would compete in 30-40 degree weather and that was in the spring. Not ideal but it is what it is. The other factor (which may or may not be important to you) is the racial mix of the student body.\nYou mention you had unforgettable feelings about being on princeton\u2019s campus which is great but you bring up a good point that you\u2019re a teenager and might not trust your feelings. You may have that feeling now but there\u2019s always a honeymoon period then reality sets in once practice and school starts and the grind becomes that\u2026a grind. Your teammmates will really shape your experience during your undergrad much more than anything else.\nI\u2019d give the nod to Stanford: prestige, high quality academics, weather and PAC-12 athletics.  Good luck!\nP.S. Now that my kid has had some experience as an Ivy athlete coming from another coast, the  drawback has been distance. The lack of family support at meets was evident and the struggle was real. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s contributed to some positive takeaways such as character building but I have to agree with @TooOld4School\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Humblest\u2026 Alumni started reaching out to them the second they were a registered group is very real.

It\u2019s a wonderful school. I wanted to post something on this discussion because I feel that there\u2019s some misinformation being put out here, or at least information that doesn\u2019t jibe with my own experience.\nI looked at Vassar early on in my college search. It\u2019s a great school, but it felt too much like the private high school I attended in San Francisco. That\u2019s a personal perspective, obviously. My high school teammate is now playing at Vassar and loves it.\nMy final college choices were Oberlin, Carleton, Macalester, Bates and Kenyon. All great schools. Of these, Kenyon felt the most comfortable for me. I\u2019m interested in the humanities (a likely English major) and Kenyon\u2019s offerings in this area seemed to be the strongest of those colleges. I loved the look of Kenyon\u2019s campus, and after 4 years of high school in the middle of San Francisco, I was also attracted to the rural setting of Kenyon.\nAs to the drinking culture at Kenyon, some of what\u2019s being presented on this thread doesn\u2019t ring true to me. Of course, there is drinking at Kenyon. But I have never felt pressured to drink, there are many students who do not drink, and I have rarely seen anyone out of control at a party. In fact, Kenyon students seem especially attuned to the dangers of excessive drinking, and we are all educated about the known linkages between alcohol consumption and other problems like sexual assault. I think Kenyon\u2019s administration does a great job in this regard.\nAs to Kenyon\u2019s Greek scene, I think this may be misunderstood unless you\u2019ve experienced it up close. Kenyon\u2019s Greek organizations are more like community service clubs than traditional fraternities and sororities. Yes, most of the Greek organizations throw parties, but they are open to the whole Kenyon community. Fraternities and sororities at Kenyon don\u2019t live together (generally) and I\u2019ve always found them to be quite inclusive even if you\u2019re not a member. I think they add a lot to the campus social scene.\nThe assertions on this thread that Kenyon has problems with alcohol consumption are untrue in my experience. I\u2019d suggest - respectfully - that unless you go to Kenyon, or are an alum, parent, or employee, then perhaps you don\u2019t have the highest-quality information to report.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: North Carolina State University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIs it a 50k over 4 years?\nNo matter - that\u2019s impressive!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Columbia University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYou missing the point, there not peers as overall universities.

What dilemma? Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale\u2019s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being \u201cinexpensive\u201d for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend.\nIn the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers).\nMany scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\u201cthere were quite a few hillbillies around the Duke campus area and felt uneasy.\u201d\nMust we resort to nonsensical scare tactics?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Harvard University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nNot sure, but I believe that part of your Foundation Fellows award at the University of Georgia is a Stamps Scholarship award.\nYou may find it helpful to read the Wikipedia entry on Stamps Scholarship/ Stamps Foundation.\nOne of the great benefits is a networking page where you can post your resume & career interests.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nVT is a solid choice.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIs it a 50k over 4 years?\nNo matter -

There is no comparison at the undergrad level.\u201d\nThe 6,000 undergraduate students (I am fairly certain it is closer to 8,000 when you include General Studies) still have to share the faculty and resources with those 23,000 graduate students. At any university, undergraduate students do not exist in a vacuum. I don\u2019t see how there\u2019s any difference CU123. Columbia has limited resources, and 31,000 students to look after. Your facts are not convincing at all. A university\u2019s endowment is shared by all of its students, graduate and undergraduate, not just by the undergraduate students. Same with a university\u2019s faculty.\nIf anything, I have provided more facts. Where are the placement figures for Columbia that show that Columbia places more graduates in Silicon Valley? I have shown how many Michigan graduates are placed in major tech firms, and I even provided comparative data from Penn. Sadly, Columbia does not publish such data. Where are the peer ratings that prove that Columbia is a far superior university to Michigan? According to the US News Peer Assessment score, Columbia\u2019s rating hovers between 4.6 and 4.7, while Michigan\u2019s hovers between 4.4 and 4.5. That makes them peers in the eyes of university presidents, deans of undergraduate colleges and provosts. And how do you prove that Columbia has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when Fu has a 25:1 ratio and the 4,500 College students share their faculty with 3,500 Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences? Those are the facts I want addressed\u2026and they are facts.\nI am still waiting for the evidence to support your claim that Columbia is a vastly superior university to Michigan to the extent that it is insulting to you that one would even suggest that they are peer institutions.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Columbia University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nLOL, @sevmom.

My roommate went to tons of parties and still did well enough to get into Columbia med with a 3.7 GPA from Hopkins.  Some of it is intelligence - another is time management.  In no way are students going out of their way to not help one another.  People know Hopkins is tough - but this fosters camaraderie since people have the same common goal.  The acceptance rate to Harvard med is like 3% - do people have much to gain by not helping their fellow man when 2 minds are better than one? I personally was not premed, but I was 1 bio course and 1 orgo course away from being one, and I did fine.\nThe only people that complain and moan about premed at Hopkins are ones that did not go there or had a tough time collaborating (luckily these are in the far minority).\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nOP\u2019s question is whether Stanford or Harvard would confer an advantage over USC or a top public ivy such as UIUC in terms of post graduation job prospects. I believe the answer is maybe in very few scenarios such as for investment banking and consulting and by firms such as Goldman Sachs and McKinsey which target a few schools for recruiting. A\nnd maybe one can argue that Stanford\u2019s proximity to Silicon Valley\u2019s ecosystem would confer some advantage for graduates interested in tech start-ups. Yes, high tech firms recruit all over the country, but the informal ways to connect with venture capitalists, founders, etc. is undeniably richer in Silicon Valley.\nAlso, in some rare situations where the employer is a foreign country-backed (particularly China) organization looking for employees with internationally prestigious education credentials, Harvard and Stanford would offer an advantage by virtue of their reputation internationally.\nThese are all very rare situations.\nFor the majority of career fields, no there would not be meaningful difference.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Washington University in St. Louis\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Bowdoin College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nBrunswick actually has a fairly hip food scene for the location.

The only way to get an engineering degree at Amherst would be through a 5-year program, where you spend years 3 and 5 at Dartmouth. Such programs are commonly offered by liberal arts colleges, but rarely utilized in practice;. Amherst says that only one or two students per class go that route.\nhttp://www3.amherst.edu/~waloinaz/engineering.html\nHMC is great for engineering, but maybe not so good for pre-med. HMC does offer common pre-med majors, like biology and chemistry, although they are less popular than engineering. However, it may be difficult to maintain a high GPA at Mudd, as noted above, especially if you also want to swim competitively:\n\n[quote]\nProspective pre-medical students considering Harvey Mudd should realize that the College\u2019s technical requirements are considerably more demanding than in typical pre-med programs\n[/quote]\n\nhttps://www.hmc.edu/biology/programs-and-courses/pre-med-preparation/\nSo while both paths are theoretically possible at both institutions, you should assume that Amherst sends far more students to med school than into engineering, while HMC sends far more students into engineering than to med school. So in practice, these two schools may not be the best choices if you are truly undecided and want to keep both options open.\nThere are few LACs that are good for both pre-med and engineering. Swarthmore would be an obvious pick, or Smith if you are female. If you can swim competitivelly at a low Division I level, then Bucknell or Lafayette. If you want to stick to Division III, then maybe consider small DIII universities, like Tufts or Rochester, as well as LACs.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Southern Methodist University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@maplefall: That one is easy to explain: Look at the criteria by how rankings rank.\nLook at how well Dartmouth ranks in any international ranking, for instance.\nOr look at how well UIUC and UW-Seattle rank in USNews.

I\u2019m not an expert, but it seems to me it might not be legal for universities to share with each other who got in and went where. If they can\u2019t do that, the data must be self-reported by the students, in which case how can it be reliable or complete?\nAlso, I wonder how Stanford characterizes a student who gets into, say, Harvard, Yale and Stanford, and enrolls at Harvard. It\u2019s a win for Harvard in cross-admits with Stanford, but how does Stanford reflect that the student was a Yale-Stanford cross-admit and chose to attend neither school? Also, is there double-counting in the total numbers of cross-admits (i.e., does that kid show up as a Stanford cross-admit with both Harvard and Yale)?\nIn this regard, the Today Show reported this morning that the set of quadruplets who all were admitted to Harvard and Yale (and at least one of which was also admitted to Stanford) have all chosen Yale (see the thread on this subject, also here: http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/ohio-quadruplets-accepted-ivies-will-attend-yale-together-n753146) - so I guess there\u2019s a real-life illustration of the problem in accounting for cross-admits to multiple places.\nFinally, as I\u2019ve said elsewhere, assuming the numbers on the Stanford slide are correct, a 10% swing in any direction with any school looks like a big shift but represents 21 or fewer people. Given that HYPS all have 70-80% yields, the overlap in the admitted students must be small. Also, I would guess, many students give a lot of weight to geography in making their decision. I would be very interested to know the choices of Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and West Coast students cross-admitted with Stanford and any of HYP.\n[/quote]\n\nNote that those quadruplets all by themselves probably represent a ~2% shift to Yale in its cross-admit match-up with Harvard, which illustrates how small the actual cross-admit numbers are and how little one can read into cross-admit trends.\n@Cue7 - thanks for all that very useful information.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Southern Methodist University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nARWU is completely research-based (so would only tell you about faculty research prowess in mostly STEM and some social sciences).

What I\u2019m not saying is that these schools decide, for example, how many Asians they want, make a list of Asian applicants and then pick out names until they get to the quota. Admissions is holistic, and candidates may check multiple boxes (this, for example, is why I believe academically elite URMs, or highly-qualified development-level legacies face significantly better odds than applicants with a single hook). I think there may be some tweaking of the final list of admits before release to keep numbers \u201cbalanced\u201d, but I think it starts by picking kids that are holistically, and collectively, the best mix for the school\u2019s needs.\nSecond, and related to the above, I\u2019m conscious that I haven\u2019t allowed for admits who fit in multiple categories. It would have been too complicated and speculative to try to adjust for that. I don\u2019t want to give the impression, though, that I don\u2019t believe anyone in my \u201cunquestionable genius\u201d category is URM or ORM, for example (I\u2019m sure plenty are), or that all international admits are either Asian or institutional priorities.

Kenyon\u2019s plays sell out on Saturday nights, and my daughter has gone to several improv shows. They are standing room only\u2014the students attend these activities! Rocky horror picture show, Harry Potter themed fun, a game of murder mystery held in one of the commons are all activities she has mentioned just in this first semester. Of course many kids go to parties afterward (my daughter usually does one of the two weekend nights) but being an athlete she sometimes turns in early or just hangs out in a friend\u2019s dorm after going to the campus activities.\nI went to an unranked small catholic college myself, and there were never activities offered on campus like that\u2026 or if they were, hardly anyone went. That is the key to look for in my opinion if you have a child who wants to do more than go to parties every weekend. Look to see what the college does offer, AND do the students attend! I tend to think because Kenyon is so rural that administration makes a conscious effort to provide opportunities on the weekends. Schools that have a big city near by often times don\u2019t bother because so many students just leave campus. Another reason that small/rural can contribute to a real sense of community.

In the 5th year of the program the student becomes a Dartmouth student where they are then subject to Dartmouth FA. Just want to point out that the curriculum at Hamilton is definitely challenging and will prepare your son well to take on the challenges at Dartmouth, perhaps better than some of the other schools. My son was able to get waived out of two courses and ended up taking more advanced alternatives at Dartmouth. I don\u2019t know the reason for this but it seems, at least for now, that more students pursue this program from Colby, Skidmore and Vassar than from Hamilton.

I believe the closest field at Stanford is Human Biology, which was Stanford\u2019s most popular major until the recent CS boom.   It\u2019s an  interdisciplinary field that lets you design a customized program based on your interests and goals, choosing courses from a good variety of other fields, outside of human biology classes.  Stanford is big on such  interdisciplinary programs like this, coterm degrees that combine BS+MS, etc.  I\u2019m not as familiar with the options at Princeton, but I do see that they offer the option to supplement major with Global Health and Health Policy and obtain a related certification, which Stanford does not have an equivalent\u2026\n\n[quote]\nWeather would typically not be a factor for me at all, except for the fact I am a recruited athlete and would have to train year round.

I think I am more sensitive to weather than most, or maybe I\u2019ve become spoiled by living in CA for so long.\nThis brings up another relevant point.    I grew up in upstate NY. I currently live in CA, largely because of the large CA presence at Stanford job fairs, and because I enjoyed the CA area while at Stanford. If you want to live/work/internship in the SV or CA area, Stanford has a strong edge. Similarly, I\u2019m sure the Princeton area has a strong college presence and a large number of area companies with special network/internship areas.

He ended up getting merit at USC but chose another school in the end. Part of the reason was that he realized he did not want to commit to living in Southern California after graduation. Also, it was not the strongest fit after he spent a night there during interview weekend. Other schools did a better job with overnight visits. The University Village is impressive on the outside but less conducive to meeting lots of people as compared with a regular dorm, based on the suite arrangements. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t meet people if you room at the Village. It\u2019s just a little less easy as a dorm such as Birnkrant.\nCosts are also very high (from rent to insurance to gas to you name it) in Los Angeles.That would be true of Boston as well. I think you are smart to consider what your ultimate goal is in terms of living and working after four years. Not everyone knows the answer but in your case, you seem to be pretty certain about working on the East Coast. Marshall Business school is strongest in L.A. and Asia. Many on CC are rah rah about the Trojan alumni network but I don\u2019t think it rings true nearly like in Southern Cal. I would go with your instincts and choose either UNC or BC. If you are like my S, you\u2019ll lean towards the school that is offering you a sure admit into the major you would like to study and where you click with the student body. You can take a chance on UNC and getting into the B school. If you don\u2019t get into the business school, you could probably major in econ or something else. Raleigh would have the second best weather of the choices  but BC offers you the direct admit to the business school in the part of the country that you would like to ultimately work.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of South Carolina\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIt appears @pbmcdoug carefully weighed his options and made a thoughtful decision.

Quality of life matters and a college needs to be a good fit in addition to offering a high quality education.\nThere\u2019s also a study by a Princeton economist found that the earnings of students from Ivies and students who were accepte at elite schools but chose to attend elsewhere were essentially the same.\n\"\"In 1999, economists from Princeton and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation looked at some of the same data Professor Eide and his colleagues had used, but crunched them in a different way: they compared students at more selective colleges to others of \u201cseemingly comparable ability,\u201d based on their SAT scores and class rank, who had attended less selective schools, either by choice or because a top college rejected them.\nThe earnings of graduates in the two groups were about the same \u2014 perhaps shifting the ledger in favor of the less expensive, less prestigious route. (The one exception was that children from \u201cdisadvantaged family backgrounds\u201d appeared to earn more over time if they attended more selective colleges. The authors, Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger, do not speculate why, but conclude, \u201cThese students appear to benefit most from attending a more elite college.\u201d)\"\"\nCongrats @pbmcdoug on making your decision.

And since you\u2019re an athlete, one other thing to consider is that there\u2019s likely to be more travel (plane rides rather than bus rides) and midweek competition at Stanford, as the conference schools (Pac 12 or MPSF, depending on sport) are much more spread out geographically for Stanford than in the Ivy League.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Middlebury College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Haverford College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nA few thoughts, money aside:\nI would say that Haverford and Smith are stronger in the sciences than Midd.\nTaking classes at Bryn Mawr is not a negative. It is very easy to do so and in fact most students in the bi-college will take at least a class or two on the other campus sometime within their 4 years. It\u2019s a seamless relationship between the two schools and should be viewed as an extension of the campus and offerings - a positive. She could also see if Swarthmore and/or UPenn have any classes she might like to take in marine bio.\nYour daughter will have no problem finding faculty mentors at Haverford (or Midd for that matter). Haverford offers plenty of student research opportunities as well as campus jobs. There is quite a bit of money available for summer research and summer internships and it pays more than $1200. Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t overweight STRIDE from the benefits you\u2019ve discussed. Being a Quaker school, Haverford isn\u2019t big on having programs that single out certain students - no honors, no Dean\u2019s List, EVERYONE does a thesis. It\u2019s all about community and equal opportunity. That doesn\u2019t mean their aren\u2019t opportunities. There are plenty available.\nAs long as your daughter is aware of the facts and knows all the pros and cons of her choices, I\u2019d let her make the decision. You were okay with her applying to schools with only need-based aid knowing that you did not qualify for it so I think you have to let her consider all her options once you\u2019ve pointed out the facts to her.\nETA: She has 3 wonderful choices and all will provide a great 4 year experience. She needs to decide where she will be happiest.\nIs the $16K total and annually?

Her friend group is geographically pretty diverse, and generally speaking (at least from her experience) students really don\u2019t know/care who is full pay or who gets financial aid. Of course there are always exceptions at every school but middkids are a prety down to earth group.  I do, however, agree with @doschicos that Bates is arguably the most laid back of the three you are considering.\nOn a side note- when my daughter visited Williams she spent the day on campus. Attended class, danced in the studio, tried to take in as much as possible. She did feel the environment was intense at Williams, that it had a similar feel to Swarthmore, and for that reason Williams did fall off of her list. At Middlebury the students seemed like they were having fun; at Williams not so much that particular day. Having said that, she has two friends at Williams and they absolutely love Williams!\nBottom line is that all three are great school and the comparisons are truly relative and certainly subjective \n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bowdoin College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Middlebury College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAre you being recruited?

Another excellent program is the Sophomore Scholars in Residence, providing students the opportunity to take a class in a variety of subject areas with an integrated travel component, and the students are housed together for the year while taking the class, as well working on long term projects. The SSIR program is fully funded with no extra costs for students.

At Penn, roughly 50% major in CS, CE-related majors, which pay significantly more. In this regard, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of majors than Penn, which seems to lean heavily on CS/CE majors.\u201d\nI agree that the mix of majors is an issue. I was only looking at Computer Science.\nFor a ME, EE, ChemE, choosing Michigan over an Ivy if it is cheaper seems to be more clear cut for most students. The pay range is much smaller for these majors and the related jobs.\n\u201cBut even then, the advantage when it comes to placing graduates in companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft clearly favors Michigan, even over the likes of Cornell\u201d\nThese 4 companies seem to be the focus of Michigan graduates. I think a lot of grads at Ivies have those options too, but may simply decide that other offers are better for them. Those 4 are not necessarily superior to other options: Facebook, AirBnB, Lyft, Bloomberg, Jane Street, D. E. Shaw, Drop Box, Palantir, etc.\nI think the better job depends on many factors: the specific duties, compensation, location, etc.\n\u201cIn the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living.\u201d\nI don\u2019t understand this. I don\u2019t think that many top CS jobs exist in the midwest that would be comparable to SF, NYC, Seattle, or Boston. There are probably a reasonable number of comparable positions in Chicago, and I am sure there are a few startups in Ann Arbor, but if a large number of CS students are staying in Michigan, then I would think that suggests that they are not getting similar positions.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Wisconsin-Madison\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@manyloyalties   I think Yale is worth the investment.

I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech.

Nonetheless, I\u2019d probably still go with the full ride from Michigan and MIT for grad school.\n\"\"The biggest issues that I might consider in the public vs private (school) analysis would be class sizes, professor-student interaction, and availability of opportunities outside of the classroom. This would include access to professors beyond posted office hours, availability of special programs, access to research opportunities, unique study abroad programs, funding for special programs/personal student projects/student clubs.\nThen try to evaluate how much you would take advantage of these special programs at the more expensive school \u2014 how \u201cnecessary\u201d vs \u201cthat would be kind of nice but no big deal\u201d are they to you? Frankly if Baskins Robbins ice cream parlor offers 31 flavors but all you ever order is chocolate \u2014 then what difference do the rest of those 30 flavors make to you? They could be the most exotic flavors on the planet, but if all you ever order is chocolate, then so what?\nMIT\u2019s price tag includes this overwhelming multitude of opportunities \u2014 but if all you want is to take a basic set of CS classes (that nearly every good university offers) and get your degree as quickly and expediently as you can \u2014 well, why pay for the extras that you\u2019re never going to use? MIT is the ultra deluxe education package deal. Is that what you and your parents want, can afford (preferably without going into debt), and are willing to pay for \u2014 because you\u2019re really going to take advantage of all of these incredible opportunities?\nOkay, so what are some of these extras?\nFor a kid who likes small instead of big, there are freshman learning communities of only 50 freshman and class sizes between 8 - 12 frosh, turning MIT into a STEM version of a LAC.; MISTI (internships all over the world, all expenses paid); IAP (a ton of fun, enriching, and/or educational things to do during the January term); externships (1 month internships during Jan term sponsored by MIT alumni); wanna do research with a professor? Word on the street is that it usually only takes on average 3 emails to snag one!; UROP (undergraduate research program); Super UROP (an extended and beefed up version of UROP); I don\u2019t know the dollar amount but pretty generous funding for the robotics clubs (I\u2019m guessing on the order of maybe $50,000?, but I really don\u2019t know so don\u2019t quote me on this one); ability to test out of required classes; personal one-on-one meetings with your advisor prior to registration every single semester; both general advisors for freshman who haven\u2019t declared yet and major-specific advisors later on; rarely a problem getting classes in your major (although ironically you might have trouble getting less essential classes like PE, glass blowing and toy design); no problems graduating in 4 years (or at least not due to impacted majors anyway); able to take upper division classes and grad classes at will, even as a freshman; prerequisites that are \u201cguidelines\u201d not requirements; athletic coaches that get the fact that your course load is hard and that you\u2019re at MIT to be a student first and an athlete second; a ton of extracurriculars and clubs (although I suspect that most public schools also have this), M.Eng. program (get your Masters in Engineering in only 1 extra year instead of 2, offered only to MIT undergrads), taking classes with professors who wrote (or are writing anew) the textbook; phenomenal, out-of-this-world research going on in the labs; tons of support (free tutoring, mental health counseling, etc.); funding for dorm activities, outings, trips to help dorm bonding; a resident professor living in every dorm and a grad stud on every floor; and, last but by no means least, the amazingness of your fellow classmates, roommates, frat mates. I could go on and on\u2026.but my hand is tired of keyboarding now. Hopefully you get the picture.\nSorry for the novel.

Yes I do not believe that the top public universities are peers of the top private universities in the area of undergraduate studies.  It is different in graduate studies where public universities operate much more like private universities albeit still at a slight disadvantage.  You only have to look at the historical slide of public universities compared to private universities (in undergraduate studies) to see it.  BTW I\u2019m not disparaging UMich by itself, I am disparaging all public unis and its not their fault.  It is the fault of the state legislatures by putting these unis in impossible situations by limiting there ability to raise in state tuition, and then cutting their funding.  This inevitably leads to ever increasing enrollments and class sizes without the appropriate increase in professors and resources which leads  to publics falling further behind privates as the privates simply don\u2019t have these constraints.  So in the end, I am advocating for more support for public universities or simply letting them become private (which will never happen for state flagships).\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of South Carolina\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nGood luck to you\u2026Oh one more thing.

But for casual members they do everything from simple hikes, biking or kayaking to extreme hiking and camping.  Not taking anything away from Midd which is a great school too but would be hard to say any school is a level up from Bowdoin on outdoorsy student opportunity.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Chicago\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\nJust to continue the weather thread and since I like facts, Palo Alto has an average temp of 58.55 degrees so if you can hang out on shorts and thongs at that temp\u2026we\u2019ll go for it.\n[/quote]\n\nIt\u2019s a dry heat though.  :))\nSeriously, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s that low, because but for a days here or there, I\u2019m nearly always in shorts either going about my daily routine or exercising.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Princeton University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAthletes are often obvious as they miss classes for games.

But, I have a 3.9 weighted GPA in the most rigorous courses at an \u201celite\u201d private school in the northeast.\nI have friends who got into Duke, Northwestern,Vanderbilt with higher test scores, but easier classes but some of those same friends were rejected from Michigan.

Vandy is a great school but it doesn\u2019t have the historical reputation that Northwestern has. Remember that as of 2-3 years ago, Vandy was a school ranked in the 18-22 range, competing with the likes of Emory, Rice, etc. Northwestern has been in the 9-13 ranking spot for the last 30 years. High school students are very impressionable by ranking shifts year-to-year but it takes DECADES to change perceptions. And if you take the average ranking for the last 20 years, Vandy is a top 20 school and certainly not a top 15 school. Based on attending Stanford for my MBA and living / working in NYC at a prestigious investment bank / mega private equity fund: my ranking would be.\nTier 1A: Duke / Northwestern / Brown / Hopkins / Dartmouth\nTier 1B: Cornell - I put this here because its selectivity is significantly less than the others. Ask anyone in a high-prestige job in NYC on Wall Street or ask students at top private prep schools (Dalton, Horace Mann, Trinity, Andover, Exeter, etc, ), they will put Cornell a step below the others. As of just a year ago, the average SAT at Cornell was almost a 90-100 points lower than Duke and Northwestern. That\u2019s significant. Cornell is really a hybrid of a private ivy league and a top tier public university like Michigan, given its state subsidized schools. Part of prestige relates to exclusivity and selectivity and Cornell is the least selective of the schools in Tier 1A and 1B.\nTier 2: Georgetown / Vanderbilt / Rice / Wash U / CMU\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Boston College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n^And you are transferring in from the University of North Dakota? as a Senior or Junior?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bates College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Middlebury College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nThanks for clarifying, Wisteria100.  I\u2019ll add that to say Middlebury has the most serious outdoor kids of the three schools makes little sense based on my observations.  I know that my son chose Bowdoin, in part, because of it\u2019s tremendous Outing Club and the school\u2019s emphasis on exploring nature.  It transformed his life.  Today he teaches, and lives, the outdoor adventure world (along with his day job of teaching biology) as do many of his Bowdoin friends now scattered about the planet combining education with the outdoors.  I\u2019ve no doubt Middlebury is similar, and have less connection with Bates.  You\u2019re correct in suggesting that Bowdoin is unique in it\u2019s balance for those who may not be interested in the outdoors\u2026It\u2019s a school set in beautiful Brunswick and attracts a wide range of students from all cultures.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: New York University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWhat the MBA/Specialty Masters degree options do for OP is give her an opportunity to refocus her career/career objectives & the opportunity to change industries & employers if so desired.\nIf not needed, then OP has $184,000 plus interest benefit for earning a top finance degree.\nP.S.

It is very easy to do so and in fact most students in the bi-college will take at least a class or two on the other campus sometime within their 4 years. It\u2019s a seamless relationship between the two schools and should be viewed as an extension of the campus and offerings - a positive. She could also see if Swarthmore and/or UPenn have any classes she might like to take in marine bio.\nYour daughter will have no problem finding faculty mentors at Haverford (or Midd for that matter). Haverford offers plenty of student research opportunities as well as campus jobs. There is quite a bit of money available for summer research and summer internships and it pays more than $1200. Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t overweight STRIDE from the benefits you\u2019ve discussed. Being a Quaker school, Haverford isn\u2019t big on having programs that single out certain students - no honors, no Dean\u2019s List, EVERYONE does a thesis. It\u2019s all about community and equal opportunity. That doesn\u2019t mean their aren\u2019t opportunities. There are plenty available.\nAs long as your daughter is aware of the facts and knows all the pros and cons of her choices, I\u2019d let her make the decision. You were okay with her applying to schools with only need-based aid knowing that you did not qualify for it so I think you have to let her consider all her options once you\u2019ve pointed out the facts to her.\nETA: She has 3 wonderful choices and all will provide a great 4 year experience. She needs to decide where she will be happiest.\nIs the $16K total and annually?

He is in the 3-2 engineering program and  loves it. Unlike the typical 3-2 where you leave the liberal arts college at the end of the 3rd year, for the Dartmouth plan the student studies at their LAC for freshman and sophomore year, then move on to Dartmouth for their junior year, when most of their friends are studying abroad. For their senior year they go back to their LAC, graduate with their friends and get their BA degree, and return back to Dartmouth for a 5th year and get their BE degree in an engineering discipline.\nWhat is nice about this program is that the student gets an excellent STEM education at the LAC with very small class sizes where they get to really know their professors and do research as an undergraduate. At Thayer (Dartmouth\u2019s Engineering School) you get a very project oriented engineering education with a strong entrepreneurial focus. Dartmouth is on a quarter system so many professors have their own engineering / tech companies they are running, bringing current real-world challenges to class.  Also, there is a certain camaraderie amongst all the 3-2 students from the various LAC\u2019s.\nTypically if you maintain a 3.5 or better at your LAC and take Calc I, II, III, Physics I, II, Chem, and CS, you get into Dartmouth. If I am not mistaken they get about 100 applicants a year, with about 40 or so getting accepted into the program each year.\nThere is no question that the 3-2 plan will require an extra year of education and the costs that go with that. However, that additional year provides you the ability to take the extensive math and science prereqs for an engineering degree, but also affords you the ability to take more humanities and social science courses. The part of the education you get at a LAC will be more discussion based (as opposed to a lecture based model), enabling you to become a more effective communicator and develop critical thinking skills. This is an investment that will make you a more marketable candidate with employers.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bates College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAs a parent of DD\u2019s that are both heavily considering Bates and Hamilton, aside from the controversial USNWR rankings I continue to read that while Hamilton isn\u2019t considered at top 4-6 LAC it has for decades been in the next tranche as compared to Bates which seems to be a notch lower - not certain why though.

Perhaps your parents are willing to part with your future inheritance in order for you to go to Yale and that is admirable. But the money is all in the same pool Assuming that you + parents are out zero for UW Madison x 4 years vs being out $240,000 for going to Yale for 4 years, in what way is that affordable?\nTo put it in perspective, if you were to invest that amount of money (the 240K) at age 22 and earn 7% per year on average until you retire at age 65 you would be ahead $4.4 million! You are not likely going into medicine for the money, but money does matter. If you are a doctor and figuring out any job, any year, any change, etc. it will always matter to you.\nObviously, Yale is Yale. And $4.4 million in retirement is $4.4 million. That is more than most doctors have in savings when funding their own retirements after a career of work. If you have children or spouse for whom you want to provide in the future, the decision is simple. UW is a good school and offers a lot of opportunities. Wisconsin also has two medical schools in state.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Carnegie Mellon University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Maryland\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n^^^^Perhaps your brother would like to contribute some money towards the additional\n240K expenditure?

He is in the 3-2 engineering program and  loves it. Unlike the typical 3-2 where you leave the liberal arts college at the end of the 3rd year, for the Dartmouth plan the student studies at their LAC for freshman and sophomore year, then move on to Dartmouth for their junior year, when most of their friends are studying abroad. For their senior year they go back to their LAC, graduate with their friends and get their BA degree, and return back to Dartmouth for a 5th year and get their BE degree in an engineering discipline.\nWhat is nice about this program is that the student gets an excellent STEM education at the LAC with very small class sizes where they get to really know their professors and do research as an undergraduate. At Thayer (Dartmouth\u2019s Engineering School) you get a very project oriented engineering education with a strong entrepreneurial focus. Dartmouth is on a quarter system so many professors have their own engineering / tech companies they are running, bringing current real-world challenges to class.  Also, there is a certain camaraderie amongst all the 3-2 students from the various LAC\u2019s.\nTypically if you maintain a 3.5 or better at your LAC and take Calc I, II, III, Physics I, II, Chem, and CS, you get into Dartmouth. If I am not mistaken they get about 100 applicants a year, with about 40 or so getting accepted into the program each year.\nThere is no question that the 3-2 plan will require an extra year of education and the costs that go with that. However, that additional year provides you the ability to take the extensive math and science prereqs for an engineering degree, but also affords you the ability to take more humanities and social science courses. The part of the education you get at a LAC will be more discussion based (as opposed to a lecture based model), enabling you to become a more effective communicator and develop critical thinking skills. This is an investment that will make you a more marketable candidate with employers.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Brown University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@whatthewhat\nYes, but at this stage in the OP\u2019s son\u2019s career, we cannot just ignore the effect of GPA.  What if he wants to go to grad school right after undergrad (some entrepreneurs chose to pursue a JD, Master in Business Analytics, MFin, MFE, etc.)?\nAlso, applications of entrepreneurship extend beyond the startup world.  I find it interesting that you mentioned startups.  One of the most important players in the startup world are VC/PE (Venture Capital/Private Equity) firms and Investment Banks (who handle M&A, IPOs, underwriting, etc.).  These firms care a lot about GPA for the limited undergrad recruitment they do.  Financing (both buy-side and sell-side) play a huge role in the startup world and the OP\u2019s son may be interesting in pursuing that as someone studying Econ.  Both schools are excellent choices for this career path and have different strengths in this regard.  One of Brown\u2019s strengths is less worrying about GPA.

I\u2019m a 2016 Pomona grad, so I can give you some specific, current insights.\nAll of the fields you are interested in are excellent at Pomona, and a liberal arts college and community can be a particularly stimulating way to explore numerous disciplines and connect readily with people across different interests.\nIt sounds like your long-term goal is a career within computer science. Here\u2019s a look at the pros and cons of Pomona\u2019s CS at present:\nPros:\n\nThe community of students, faculty, and alumni is exceptional. People look out for one another and are encouraging, supportive, and kind. Your feedback is taken seriously and whenever you need help or advising, there is a lot of receptiveness to that.\n\n\nPrepares you well academically for graduate school. Pomona is one of the top feeder schools on a per capita basis to computer science PhD programs. In fact, many people who are presently at grad school have told me the teaching and individual attention is clearly far above that of the major university they are a part of (in their own classes and in their TA capacities for undergrads there). \nExcellent outcomes. Whether you want to go to a reputable graduate program or top notch industry job, Pomona will help you get there. I've never heard of anyone having difficulty on this regard. The Claremont Colleges are collectively seen as a target school by many tech companies, and ample on-campus recruiting and interviews make it easy to land a job or internship. Many of my friends leave with six figure salaries straight after graduation in many of the famous tech companies. For graduate school, I can't think of anyone who didn't end up at a top 10 program (MIT, Berkeley, Cornell, etc). Pomona is also one of the top schools for students getting STEM fellowships like the NSF, Goldwater, Churchill, etc.\nEasy to engage with research and get funding for internships, independent projects, conferences, etc. This is just true for Pomona in general- there is a lot of money and programs designed to help students fund whatever they are passionate about. Harvey Mudd has a 5 college summer computer science research program as well. \n\nMixed:\n\nDoing internships in LA. There are a surprising number of tech companies within the metro area, so theoretically, that would enable students to gain other experiences during the year. Most of them are in West LA/Santa Monica, however, which is quite far from Claremont (50 miles or so). Public transportation will take you 2.5 hours each way, so it\u2019s pretty necessary to have a car. But then you have to deal with LA traffic. There are a couple of tech experiences a bit closer- Pasadena, Downtown LA, USC Innovation Lab. Getting to DTLA from Claremont via public transportation is pretty straightforward.\n\nCons:\n\nClasses are not as small as they are in other departments of the college. Pomona\u2019s average class size is 15, but it is difficult to find a CS class with fewer than 25 students. That said, almost none tend to be over 50 either, and even in larger classes professors take the time to know the students individually.\n\n\nLots of interest, but not the most ideal set-up to accommodate it. Getting into CS classes is tough if you're a non-major (they advise students to declare immediately upon arriving). If you're a CS major, you'll definitely have priority in order to graduate with the degree within four years, but many popular electives can be locked out. Pomona did just hire 2 more full time faculty, so hopefully that helps a bit. Mudd is presently in their own crisis for CS and honestly, there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen. I think you can count on Mudd if you want to do research with a professor there, but if you want to get into a specific course, it's probably going to be a lottery (for them and for us). \nThe emphasis is pretty theoretical and isn't the sort of pre-professional, project based work that you would want to present to someone in the industry. Students and liaisons step in to cover that aspect (hackathons, student led teaching, collaborative service-based projects, etc), but the department itself is very academic. One way to alleviate this is to do Harvey Mudd's Computer Science Clinic, in which you do an industry-based project as your senior thesis. It's open to CS students regardless of home school. Most students will intern in their summers while doing research during the school year at Pomona, allowing them to be prepared both for academia and for the industry. \nSmaller course selection within CS- at the end of the day, most of your experiences will be coming from Pomona, and it's a small school with just 1600 students and 240 professors in total. \n\n===\nYou mentioned Johns Hopkins\u2019s stronger alumni network. I have a close friend at JHU, and that\u2019s actually one of her biggest complaints with the school. She said that it can be difficult as an undergrad to benefit from alumni experiences. All of the various constituent colleges like Bloomberg, Med School, etc. have independent identities. I think what you\u2019re referring to is that JHU is a larger school, so the alumni reach is much bigger. But in terms of actually connecting to alums and being advised from them, I feel like a small LAC like Pomona fosters a special dynamic to give back. Forbes says that 31% of Pomona grads donate, ranking it #25 for \u201cMost Grateful Grads\u201d, while JHU is 13% and ranks #48. I\u2019ve seen a lot of my CS classmates come back to Pomona to seek out interns for the companies they\u2019re working at, and there\u2019s also a larger network of 5C alums eager to support one another! So you\u2019re not only looking at people from Pomona, but from Mudd, Scripps, Pitzer, and CMC as well who you can reach out to.\nThat said, JHU is definitely more well-known, and is a world-class research university. I believe their philosophy department was just given a $75 million dollar gift. And it seems you\u2019ve identified specific facilities that excite you. So I can see the dilemma.\nObviously, I\u2019d pick Pomona, but I\u2019m biased. But I think if you\u2019re confident about graduate school, Pomona can help launch you to the best ones out there (and the top facilities involved with them) while giving you a transformative, once in a lifetime liberal arts college experience. Pomona is known for its rigorous academics coupled with a high quality of life & happy students. The Claremont Colleges really enrich the experience and help the school feel larger and more exciting. I\u2019m looking at a website of ratings based on student reviews, and out of 10 (the maximum):\nJohns Hopkins vs Pomona-\nEducation Quality: 8.4 vs 8.8\nIndividual Focus: 6.6 vs 9.1\nCollaboration: 6.6 vs 8.9\nFriendliness: 7.4 vs 9.2\nFaculty Accessibility: 7.3 vs 9.3\nSocial Life: 6.0 vs 7.5\nScholastic Success: 7.7 vs 8.9\nExtracurricular Activities: 7.0 vs 8.0\nUniversity Resources: 7.3 vs 8.5\nOn another website:\nOverall Experience at Pomona- 4.65/5\nOverall Experience at Johns Hopkins- 4.04/5\nIt seems that students are more content at Pomona \nGood luck with your decision- there are pros and cons to both. They\u2019re almost opposites of each other to an extent, but you\u2019re sure to have a great experience either way!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Notre Dame\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@MYOS1634, well, there is no \u201cpre-business\u201d at UVa so no one knows how many wanted McIntire as freshmen.\nHere are the UVa admissions stats: https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/undergrad/application-process-uva\nAnd McIntire for transfers (where they openly say they are biased towards VA CC applicants):\nhttps://www.commerce.virginia.edu/undergrad/application-process-transfer\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@JenniferClint : Duke is a good school.

She went to visit all 3 schools ( and a few others) and made a list about what she liked about them and where she could see herself over the next 4 years.  She ultimately ended up choosing University of Maryland since they had given her a full ride and she knew she wanted to continue her studies in grad school when she finished undergrad and didn\u2019t want a huge amount of debt.  Each of the 3 programs are very strong and each campus has their strengths. Your son should try to choose where he feels will be the best fit for him not only academically but socially too.  When your son visits I suggest he also tries to sit in on a class or 2 to see what the academics are like.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Harvard University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nKeep in mind that GT sends less students overall to med school, because most of their students have no desire.

But, the unfortunate truth is that Rice\u2019s great reputation in Texas doesn\u2019t travel to the to the coasts well. In NYC (arguably, the world\u2019s capital), you will often get a blank stare when you tell someone you went to Rice. And yes, this is even among a lot of educated people. As one of my good friends went there, I have great respect for the school and its students / alumni but the reality is that it is considered more of a regional school in the NE and on the West Coast. The reasons for the less than expected footprint is its lack of well known grad programs (Law, Medical, Business, etc) and its smaller class size that was historically 50%+ Texan. This means there are very few Rice alumni on the coasts. Rice is unquestionably a great school but Northwestern is on another level in terms of reputation, name recognition and general prestige. You have a ton of Northwestern alumni in New York, LA, SF, Chicago, etc. If you can endure a Chicago winter, then I think Northwestern should be the clear winner here. Also, Northwestern has significantly more geographical diversity - it has more students from California, New York, NJ, Texas and Florida in one class year than is the total size of Rice. And that combined with its Big 10 sports, very large endowment, top grad programs (Kellogg, Feinberg, Law School) and successful alumni across industries (Colbert, CEO of IBM, etc.) make it more of a well known name. Northwestern is the \u2018safer\u2019 decision here given its more established reputation across disciplines.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Harvard University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\nHowever, my parents are only willing to contribute 15k a year to my education [\u2026]\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote]\nThe Vandy scholarship is full tuition, I would still be responsible for approximately 22k a year.\n[/quote]\n\ngoing to vandy for $7K is\u2026 a great deal. i would think about that. i know vandy doesn\u2019t include loans in their financial aid packages, but would you be able to apply for some + work study?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWhile the  admit rate was 37% for GT instate, I am baffled as to why anyone would think that is a problem.

Do not choose it for the law school value.  You can make the law school choice at a much later date, after you have a better idea of your future geography and likely apply to some T14s as well.  (Do not underestimate how much more difficult it is to get a BigLaw interview, let alone a job, at a firm outside the region as an Alabama law student than it would be as a T14 law student.  The difference in ranking between, say, a #10 and #27 is much larger than it may seem and is not analogous to undergrad ranking systems, where such a difference would be slight.)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYou caught me this is Christian Leattner\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Brown University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nThis is really such a matter of fit.\nI went to Duke, D will be going to Brown, and we both loved Berkeley when we visited for a 2 day program.  Although Duke is located in the South, most of the kids come from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, California and Florida.  Duke does not feel like a Southern school and even though it\u2019s not located in a major city, there is constantly a lot going on with incredible speakers from all over the world and all sorts of research opportunities.  After taking the college tour, my D\u2019s comment was \u201cmom, there is so much going on there, it feels like they are throwing opportunities at you.\u201d  FWIW, Melinda Gates went to Duke and has donated a lot of money there.  Duke is constantly is reaching out to its Alumni to create internships and all sorts of learning opportunities for its students.  Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley.\nI think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn\u2019t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates.\nBut these were our impressions. Hopefully others can give you theirs too so you can get a better feel about if there\u2019s a consistent theme.   Good luck, and you really can\u2019t go wrong.

Unfortunately, though, I think Hamilton is going to be unaffordable for us - definitely would be at 5 years.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\nAnd there are many opportunities outside engineering firms for engineers.\n[/quote]\n\nYes, and for about the same salary as a computer programmer.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@stevensPR and you seem to keep ignoring that cornell cannot be directly compared to JHU because it has many different nontraditional schools?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Penn95, re: the first line of your post, I\u2019d love to see the numbers; absent that, I\u2019ll regard it as another unsupported assertion.

Clayton Spencer has been true to her word, the paryting has been diminished. Trick or Drink is relegated to history. I think a lot of it has been due to improving relations with Lewiston.

No, D is not an athlete and has zero interest. Bates has about 40% athletes, I believe. Atheltics are very important to the school, and I suspectbits to keep the alumni happy in large part. D was worried about athletes. Her concerns were unfounded. She would say that everyone just gets along. No competitiveness, definitrly no slacking though. D mades the Dean\u2019s list, which 25% of students achieve. She loves it. She likes being around other smart, motivated kids.\n@Chembiodad Bates has an extremely high rate of grad school acceptance. It is number 5 in producing Fulbright Scholars. Cornell produced 15, Bates had 13 last year. Given its size, that\u2019s a heck of an achievement. I think Bates doesn\u2019t care too much about USNWR.

Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful.\nCornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application.\nAs for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent.

Students can take almost unlimited classes as satisfactory/no credit . The deadline to drop a class is at the last day of classes. Also with no distribution requirements, students are largely taking classes they are excited to be in, rather than to fulfill requirements.\nBrown only gives grades of A, B and C with no A- or B+, etc. so if a student doesn\u2019t get a 4.0 in the class, the next possible grade is a 3.0. So some students who are not getting As and in some cases, even Bs, will drop a class at the end of the semester rather than taking a grade that will substantially lower their GPA. Brown also does not give Ds and Fs. Any grade lower than a C and it\u2019s as if the class never existed on your transcript.\nThe A-B-C grade system also sometimes result in the cutoff for an A being a little more generous than at a school where the next lowest grade is a 3.7 rather than a 3.0. but, there is a degree of grade deflation as well when the student with a 3.6-3.7 average in the class gets a B/3.0 as a final grade.\nGPA inflation is not the same thing as grade inflation in individual classes.  The quality and quantity of work that is required to get an A in a class at Brown is not at some lower level than its peer schools. Like many peer schools,   most classes  at Brown don\u2019t have a bell curve distribution for assigning grades, so if 60% of the students do A level work then 60% of the students will get As.  But students shouldn\u2019t choose Brown thinking  it\u2019s going to be a lot easier to get an A than somewhere else.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bates College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Middlebury College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nDoes vegging with friends count as a sport?

He ended up getting merit at USC but chose another school in the end. Part of the reason was that he realized he did not want to commit to living in Southern California after graduation. Also, it was not the strongest fit after he spent a night there during interview weekend. Other schools did a better job with overnight visits. The University Village is impressive on the outside but less conducive to meeting lots of people as compared with a regular dorm, based on the suite arrangements. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t meet people if you room at the Village. It\u2019s just a little less easy as a dorm such as Birnkrant.\nCosts are also very high (from rent to insurance to gas to you name it) in Los Angeles.That would be true of Boston as well. I think you are smart to consider what your ultimate goal is in terms of living and working after four years. Not everyone knows the answer but in your case, you seem to be pretty certain about working on the East Coast. Marshall Business school is strongest in L.A. and Asia. Many on CC are rah rah about the Trojan alumni network but I don\u2019t think it rings true nearly like in Southern Cal. I would go with your instincts and choose either UNC or BC. If you are like my S, you\u2019ll lean towards the school that is offering you a sure admit into the major you would like to study and where you click with the student body. You can take a chance on UNC and getting into the B school. If you don\u2019t get into the business school, you could probably major in econ or something else. Raleigh would have the second best weather of the choices  but BC offers you the direct admit to the business school in the part of the country that you would like to ultimately work.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Carnegie Mellon University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAgree , ignore your brother unless he is paying.

JHU is well known in silicon valley - far more from my subjective experience versus any LAC given none of them having an engineering school save for Mudd (which is also a relative unknown).  It helps that JHU\u2019s ex-president is heavily involved in the community and Stanford (Will Brody).  And it doesn\u2019t hurt that IBM\u2019s ex ceo and chairman of the board (Samuel J. Palmisano) is a JHU alum.\nContrary to @nostalgicwisdom  Go to US News and compare JHU to Pomona:\nAlumni giving rank: #6 amongst all universities (37.5%) vs Pomona (27.6%) 54th amongst all LACs.\nAcademic Reputation: JHU (4.6) Top 5 amongst all universities versus 4.4 for Pomona - top 20 amongst LACs.\nDisclaimer:  Former JHU undergrad alum and MIT grad alum working at Google now in Mountain View.  I would choose JHU in a heartbeat and it also helps they wanted you first.  If you tell people in the valley you majored at Comp Sci at Pomona, a non-insignificant amount would have assumed you went to Calpoly Pomona since the latter actually has an engineering school.  No need to make that distinction with Hopkins.\nAs for the network, yes it exists.  I and several other JHU grads have referred fellow JHU alums to Google.  We have an SF JHU young alumni chapter that takes care of other alums for tech jobs too.\nPomona isn\u2019t even the top ranked LAC in US News and it does not compare to Hopkins from a CS level.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Carnegie Mellon University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Maryland\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nThis is easy.

And Stanford has no shortage of kids that are not the least bit intellectually curious. But the level of discussion in the classrooms and the level of intellectual engagement she experienced was, in the aggregate, qualitatively different among kids at Yale, Stanford, and U Chicago that they were at schools like Vanderbilt, USC, Wash U., etc. (And I agree, getting an overall feel for a school is a bit like blind men poking at an elephant and oftentimes one sees what one wants to see.) Ultimately, for my daughter, it was a matter of not wanting to be a big fish in a smaller pond; she wanted a bigger pond in which to swim.\n(And yes, UChicago was a definite contender but she didn\u2019t want the weather; Yale was initially her top choice until she got to New Haven and hated it; she thought about Reed, but ultimately decided not to apply because they did not offer any merit aid (the only non-HYPS schools she applied to were those that offered significant merit aid and she submitted separate scholarship applications to any school that required them). She would have been all over Deep Springs had they been accepting applications from women last year.\nAnd as @rickle1 points out, there is a \u201cBig difference between \u201cshould I pay vs. could I pay?\u201d If you\u2019re fortunate enough to be in the \u201cShould I pay\u201d group, really think about the \u201cwhy\u201d. If it\u2019s meaningful, pay, if not, don\u2019t.\u201d It seems that OP is in that group. And @MYOS1634 is quite correct, there are plenty of families that are tempted to pull the rug out from their kids\u2019 feet when faced with this type of decision.\nMy daughter was very, very concerned about the finances and she is very well aware that money that is spent on her undergraduate tuition is money that might otherwise be used for other things (e.g., putting a down payment on a home or investing in stocks). In creating her list, we encouraged her to cast a wide net among in-state publics (UCs), LACs and research universities that offered merit aid, and HYPS, etc. and that we would consider her options when we had the results.\nEvery situation and every family is different.

The important thing for you is getting a lot of guidance on how to capitalize on all of those opportunities. The opportunities they offer will not benefit you if you don\u2019t know they exist or how to access and prioritize them. That is why I recommend that you begin by discussing that with an admissions counselor. Penn has incredible opportunities, but it is also fairly large and complex.

For instance, many, many students wish they could be in your shoes and attend Madison.\nAnother issue, and I hope this isn\u2019t too personal.  But if you are expected to pay full freight at Yale, this means that your family is full pay.  I understand that some full pay families are right on the bubble, expected to cover the complete COA even though a family might feel that this is beyond their means.  However, if I am reading things right, your family is willing to pay 220K towards your Yale education, and you are expected to handle the remaining 60K?\nQuestion: why aren\u2019t you or your parents suggesting what strikes me as the obvious?  \u201cSon (or dear daughter), you will attend UW-Madison, and we will finance your medical school costs up to 220K.\u201d  In other words, if medical school is in your future, why spend so much of everyone\u2019s money (yours (in the form of future debt) and your parents\u2019) on undergrad?  Am I missing something?\nIf your family could comfortably afford Yale, that would be different.  If the debt were lower (let\u2019s say 30K, which many students do take on; debt is the reality for most college students), maybe that would change things, too (even though I don\u2019t think Yale is worth 30K in debt, not when the other option is practically free).

The first year of Dartmouth gets treated as a study abroad year. In Hamilton\u2019s case, the cost of attending Dartmouth was about $3K more, so we were responsible for the additional $3K. In the 5th year of the program the student becomes a Dartmouth student where they are then subject to Dartmouth FA. Just want to point out that the curriculum at Hamilton is definitely challenging and will prepare your son well to take on the challenges at Dartmouth, perhaps better than some of the other schools. My son was able to get waived out of two courses and ended up taking more advanced alternatives at Dartmouth. I don\u2019t know the reason for this but it seems, at least for now, that more students pursue this program from Colby, Skidmore and Vassar than from Hamilton. Best of luck to your son.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Texas at Austin\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Southern Methodist University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWhat does she want to do/study?

Private universities are making up numbers to help their rankings while public universities cannot because their data are audited for accuracy. Columbia claims to have a 6:1 student to faculty ratio. LOL!    Someone must have forgotten to include the 6,500 thousand graduate students enrolled at Fu and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. in that calculation. That Fu. There are 190 professors. If you just include the 1,600 undergraduate students in the student to faculty ratio calculation, you get a very respectable 8:1 ratio. Now add the 3,100 graduate students enrolled at Fu to the equation, which Columbia conveniently omits, and the ratio swells to 25:1. Columbia also conveniently omits 3,300 graduate students enrolled in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Overall, Columbia\u2019s student to faculty is well over 12:1, and yet it reports a 6:1 ratio.\nThose rankings consider faculty salaries in their rankings. Columbia professors (as well as professors in most urban universities) obviously earn significantly more than Michigan professors (and professors in most college towns and rural areas) since the cost of living in NYC far exceeds the cost of living in Ann Arbor. I am not sure how that is a fair comparison.\nThere are many more inconsistencies and methodology flaws that benefit private universities and hurt public universities. That does not make private universities better than public universities.\n\u201cBTW I\u2019m not disparaging UMich by itself, I am disparaging all public unis and its not their fault. It is the fault of the state legislatures by putting these unis in impossible situations by limiting there ability to raise in state tuition, and then cutting their funding.\u201d\nMichigan\u2019s financial status is not  common for a public university. Michigan\u2019s endowment stands at $9.6 billion, 8th largest in the nation. With 50% of its undergraduate students coming from OOS, most of which pay full tuition, Michigan has a very healthy tuition income stream.\n\u201cThis inevitably leads to ever increasing enrollments and class sizes without the appropriate increase in professors and resources which leads to publics falling further behind privates as the privates simply don\u2019t have these constraints.\u201d\nPrivate universities do not have financial constraints? With the exception of Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Stanford, I would say most private universities have financial constraints. Columbia\u2019s financial position is no better than Michigan\u2019s.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: New York University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nBut there is a somewhat reasonable case why choosing Wharton is actually the better decision, especially if you like the culture/campus a lot more and potentially want to switch majors, so this isn\u2019t a ridiculous question.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Johns Hopkins University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI have a son at GaTech, junior if anyone has questions on that school.  Familiar with Baltimore and Atlanta and both\nstudent bodies\nGaTech by state law accepts over 50% Georgia students.  All valedictorians in Georgia get automatically accepted at GaTech IF their high school meets some criteria set by the Georgia Legislature.\nGaTech is more fun loving student body, and less intense workload  than JHU.   Gatech has an excellent collaboration with Emory and a shuttle bus for BME students who want to work with medical doctors.\nI would choose GaTech over JHU for the social aspects of undergraduate education.\nRemember a BME undergrad  is going to either get a PhD or go to medical school, so getting plenty more education at least four more years of med school or six more years of research and classes for a PhD.\nThe rank difference is not that big between JHU and GaTech.  GaTech is arguably better for the design aspects of BME, the mechanical engineering side of BME.\nSystems biology, maybe a bit better at JHU, if you are looking for research work.  GaTech is particularly good at imaging sciences, tissue research, see their materials science and chemical engineering department, and of course anything related to design is superb at GaTech.\nEngineering overall is better at GaTech compared to JHU if thats your bent as well.\nCaltech is in a class by itself, with mathematics thats way more advanced, so a student needs to have mastered Calculus 3, and even part of differential equations to be able to earn Bs at Caltech in freshman math.  It starts with Analysis.  Caltech freshman have typically passed a college level physics class and that is assumed knowledge to start beginning required physics at Caltech, required for every major there.\nGaTech, if you score a 7/7 on IB Physics, you can place out of freshman physics, if you want to and take a more advanced physics class, or repeat as you see fit.  Physics is not the hardest class you will take at GaTech,probably, if you are taking freshman physics.\nJHU and GaTech are not as challenging (ball busting???)  as Caltech in physics and mathematics.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Vanderbilt University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Northwestern University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nMeasuring prestige from an IB Office is quite limited and only reflects one point of view.

And Stanford has no shortage of kids that are not the least bit intellectually curious. But the level of discussion in the classrooms and the level of intellectual engagement she experienced was, in the aggregate, qualitatively different among kids at Yale, Stanford, and U Chicago that they were at schools like Vanderbilt, USC, Wash U., etc. (And I agree, getting an overall feel for a school is a bit like blind men poking at an elephant and oftentimes one sees what one wants to see.) Ultimately, for my daughter, it was a matter of not wanting to be a big fish in a smaller pond; she wanted a bigger pond in which to swim.\n(And yes, UChicago was a definite contender but she didn\u2019t want the weather; Yale was initially her top choice until she got to New Haven and hated it; she thought about Reed, but ultimately decided not to apply because they did not offer any merit aid (the only non-HYPS schools she applied to were those that offered significant merit aid and she submitted separate scholarship applications to any school that required them).

Her friend group is geographically pretty diverse, and generally speaking (at least from her experience) students really don\u2019t know/care who is full pay or who gets financial aid. Of course there are always exceptions at every school but middkids are a prety down to earth group.  I do, however, agree with @doschicos that Bates is arguably the most laid back of the three you are considering.\nOn a side note- when my daughter visited Williams she spent the day on campus. Attended class, danced in the studio, tried to take in as much as possible. She did feel the environment was intense at Williams, that it had a similar feel to Swarthmore, and for that reason Williams did fall off of her list. At Middlebury the students seemed like they were having fun; at Williams not so much that particular day. Having said that, she has two friends at Williams and they absolutely love Williams!\nBottom line is that all three are great school and the comparisons are truly relative and certainly subjective \n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nNot sure if this is an option, but does either school have a 5 year bs/mba program?

And where you can get the most opportunity to do research and intermships. Pitt is known for excellent sciences and has the Universy of Pittsburgh medical center right on campus for easy opportunity and access to gain experience through shadowing, research or internships. Yale students are generally brilliant so the question is if your competition are geniuses will you be able to do as well in the premed coursework there as at Pitt? And compete with them for internships, research opportunities?  This is not at all to belittle the quality of students at Pitt, which are of excellent quality too, but you can\u2019t compare the selective admissions process of Yale vs Pittsburgh. I hear anecdotally that the premed curriculum at Pitt is very rigorous and achieving high grades there will be difficult as well. You should try and speak to some premed students at both schools and find out how good are the premed professors at each school and how are the grading practices is each. Sometimes the grading at the more selective school, such as Yale,  is higher than at a less competitive school, particularly a state school where professors seek to weed out a majority of the class.  This could help you make the decison. Med schools don\u2019t care so much what undergrad school you go to as much as how you do in the sciences and what experience you obtain, showing a demonstrated interest in medicine. However if you decide to switch out of premed then Yale would provide more opportunity in my opinion. Also ask yourself if you thrive better as a big fish in a little pond (I.e., at Pitt)  or not?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Rutgers University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n\n\n njdadjets:\n[quote]\nwhat I call the \u201cStevens Dilemma\u201d where a school like Stevens gives huge scholarship discounts to freshmen who fail to pull a 3.0 and thereafter lose that mo ru.\n[/quote]\n\nNot sure why that would be a Stevens-specific issue.  Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).  But if the GPA minimum is something like 3.5, that can be more of an issue, since students have to protect their GPAs like pre-meds do.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bates College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Bowdoin College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\nMidd owns it\u2019s own private ski resort that students ski down in their gowns as part of a graduation ritual.\n[/quote]\n\nOnly the Feb admits/grads.

But a candidate from USC could easily be in the same PhD program post grad with them and would be very intellectual indeed.\nWill there be kids at USC that didn\u2019t have the stats to get into hyps or even Chicago. Sure. But they might be just as smart and turn it on in college or they aren\u2019t but they work hard and e d up starting the next Twitter.  Who knows.\nBut a blanket statement that usc kids not being intellectual is just silly imho.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nN.B.

Its also  ok if there are a few general courses\nHowever if both departments are taking same set of courses it means many will get weeded out from the major they want isnt it?\nPurdue and TAMU and Vtech states clearly that first year is General engg where all freshmen take same courses right?\nHowever Calpoly SLO - you are taking classes related to CS from Day 1.\nI would like someone to confirm if at Penn State - all freshmen are taking same set of classes or the set of classes pertaining to their major with a few common ones.

What dilemma? Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale\u2019s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being \u201cinexpensive\u201d for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend.\nIn the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers).\nMany scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Northwestern University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rice University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nFor premed rice seems like a no brainer.

This is why they are offering a full ride, plus a stipend (they are paying you to attend!), plus money for research and internet travel, plus several other perks.  What is Harvard\u2019s pitch? Nothing, aside from admission.  Harvard will not sweeten the deal (there is no deal; you\u2019ve been admitted; that\u2019s it).  Harvard will not work to compete with other offers.

The incoming GPAs and standardized test scores are nearly identical, and BU has a ~6 percentage point lower acceptance rate likely because it draws from a comparitively more extensive international applicant pool.

I have an incoming Hokie engineer, wait listed at Cornell and a few others, accepted early action for UVA Engineering. Based on family income, it\u2019s possible we could pay less at one of the wait listed schools, but it sounds like Cornell isn\u2019t likely to offer much. And even then, we got great vibes at VT, loved the campus, and kid loves sports (both playing and spectating) and feels the extracurriculars are an especially good fit. Reading the comments from those who\u2019ve had kids at VT, their impressions of the Cornell grind, and positive impressions of the culture compared to other campuses makes me think it\u2019s time to fully commit and stop checking wait list status. Similar to your experience with the Cornell prestige, plenty of people both in and OOS, think we\u2019re nuts for turning down UVA.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Amherst College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Dartmouth College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n^Current students are preferable, of course.

She had a range from no aid to very good merit. We really, really struggled with the decision, but it came down to Cornell, ranked #11 for engineering, and VT, ranked #14.\nCornell was too expensive for us, and the other schools just didn\u2019t measure up. She cried for 24 hours, then she was over it.\nShe is finishing up her freshman year. She made Deans list last semester (no worries about getting her first choice major) She lives in the engineering housing (Lee Hall, Hypatia  for women, Galileo for men) which has probably made a difference- everyone is taking the same classes and so they all have to study at the same times, no pressure to party when you should study.\nMy favorite part? Everyone seems so happy to be there. When we were wandering around campus trying to come to terms with turning down \u201can Ivy\u201d , kids would literally just start talking to us. \u201cWould your daughter like to see my dorm room? I live in Lee Hall\u201d or telling us about their plans for graduate school, how their classes went, what they thought about work-life balance. Literally random girls we met while petting their dogs. Tons of cute dogs.\nThe parents we met at restaurants were nice, and many were alums. They showed us photos of their kids, they asked us to let them know what she decided. Every single person we met was so great. There were NINE rainbows on our drive home. It was just so great. It IS so great.\nMy friend is a CEO of a tech company in the research triangle. She says \u201csome of the best engineers I hire are VT grads\u201d\nI\u2019m sorry, I am a little biased, but, really, it\u2019s the whole package. Rutgers is basically a commuter campus.

Nobody comes around in the morning to ask if you remembered your vitamins or to take your dirty clothes to the laundry. The big difference is that classes at a LAC are consistently small (usually &lt; 20 students, seldom 50 or more); there are no (or few) pre-professional majors (architecture, business, engineering, etc.); total focus is on undergrads; there are fewer majors and course offerings.\nIn some respects, LACs may be more challenging for undergrads than research universities, although I\u2019m generalizing here (not directly comparing McG & MoHo). At a LAC, you generally can\u2019t sleep your way through a lecture class without the professor noticing. You can expect more class discussion. You\u2019ll probably have more faculty-graded writing assignments, more essay (or short answer) questions on exams, and fewer easily-graded multiple choice (or true/false) tests. You\u2019ll be expected not only to keep up with the reading for class, but also to think about and discuss it, starting in year one. If you cut classes, your absence is more likely to be noticed soon. Grading standards could be tougher or easier (it depends on the school).\nMontreal should have a strong edge in internship opportunities over South Hadley and Amherst (although I\u2019m not familiar with how jobs/internships work for internationals in Canada.)  If money is no object, Montreal is a great restaurant city with shops, museums, etc., that you won\u2019t find in the South Hadley area.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Virginia\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nNote that \u201carse\u201d was spelled correctly in rugby context.\nBut seriously, Michigan has the highest ranked law school in this group (usually regarded as a top 6 or 7 law school by Big Law), and they admit roughly 70-80 Michigan graduates annually.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Wisconsin-Madison\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYale.

Those PhDs will hire stem majors over b-school. Yes if you dbl major in a stem field, even better, and either college would allow study of bus and stem.  I have also seen people with undergrad only, move to portfolio management, prop trading out from reseach.   Point is stem is the better foot in the door for an undergrad.  If you excel, maybe PhD is the next step.  If less so, maybe work experience then MBA.   STEM undergrad degrees are more rigorous than undergrad business, and that would open many more  doors.

Ultimately, my best advise is to go with your own \u201cgut\u201d feelings.\nWhen my son was making his list of schools to apply to, we had a specific strategy with which then we prioritized based on my son\u2019s desired factors. The first and foremost was the institution\u2019s overall undergraduate quality and experience. While we don\u2019t take any college rankings seriously, it\u2019s really no surprise that Princeton comes in as a perennial #1 at each new publication of the USNWR. Princeton\u2019s students-to-teacher ratio of 5:1 is the best there is. Coupled that with their Preceptorial Method, which is a modified version of the Oxford tutorial, what you have is an outstanding undergraduate learning experience.\nBy intention, Princeton has set their institutional focus on undergraduate more than graduate students. Their undergraduate population is only 5,232 while the graduate population is 2,747. Stanford, on the other hand, has about 2,000 more undergraduate population than Princeton and about 11,000 graduate population. Again, by institutional design, Princeton doesn\u2019t have Law, Medical and Business schools. Princeton\u2019s endowment per student is also perennially ranked #1 with $2.7M endowment per student, while Stanford is ranked #5 with $1.5M. And Princeton\u2019s alumni giving, an important signifier of undergrad student satisfaction, is also perennially at #1.\nSince you mentioned it, HYP has that elite \u201cIvy League\u201d prestige while Stanford has its own \u201cStanford prestige.\u201d While Stanford prestige might still grow and no matter how much it could possibly gain with time, it still isn\u2019t the same as the HYP\u2019s Ivy League mystique. And it\u2019s not like HYP and other Ivy League are at stand still while Stanford forges ahead leaps and bounds with prestige-building. It\u2019s not that my son and I don\u2019t like Stanford. When we made a priority list of colleges to apply to, Stanford was 4th on our list after HYP, and that was strictly based on our assessment of undergrad qualities and experiences. My son loves Princeton as the right place to get his undergrad degree while he\u2019s aiming at Stanford as one of top few grad schools to apply to. As an undergraduate-focused institution, my son would rather bet on the institution with 2,000 less undergrad students. Less chance to get lost in the shuffle.\nBut these remarks are my and my son\u2019s take. Everyone\u2019s needs are different. Ultimately, as I stated at the very beginning, go with your own gut feelings after exhaustively investigating on undergrad quality comparisons. Good luck with your decision making. Either way, you\u2019ll be in a great place.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Waitwhatss - First, take a deep breath.

Most of the wary ones can do just fine, but they need more exposure.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  It\u2019s still a \u201cTrain up a \u2018puppy\u2019 in the way they should go\u201d deal (vs the way one feels \u201ceveryone\u201d should be trained up).  It\u2019s the end success that matters, not the means to get there.  (Success being defined the same for both, of course.)\nStudents who love learning and challenge often love the big research schools (or any challenging class in any school) - challenge accepted.  Others, not so much.  It\u2019s all ok.  One just can\u2019t put a square peg into a round hole because they think that\u2019s the only way one can succeed.  That\u2019s when failure tends to happen.\nFWIW, this is not at all about lowering the bar with final knowledge - wanting pure memorization instead of true learning.  That\u2019s its own issue and definitely grates on my nerves as an educator when it\u2019s an end goal for any level of learning.  It\u2019s been around forever.  I recall not really understanding Calc until I got to actually use it in Physics.  My students do well in high school because I emphasize teaching them how to reason and think, not because I teach them \u201cStep 1 is to do this.\u201d  Granted, vocab has to be mostly memorized, but once that language is learned, most of the rest can be reasoned out.  Some vocab can be reasoned out as well if one knows root meanings.  The teachers considered the best by students at our school are those who teach (in an understandable way) using concepts for real life applications.  But that\u2019s totally different than whether a student will do better with challenge or confidence building.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWhat major?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Hamilton College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Wesleyan University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@Waitwhatss\nhttps://www.gafutures.org/hope-state-aid-programs/hope-zell-miller-scholarships/zell-miller-scholarship/maintaining-eligibility-for-the-zell-miller-scholarship/\nHere are the guidelines.

Some majors require GPAs as high as 3.2.\n2 and #3 - As your email or letter states, you were accepted into the COLLEGE but with an intended major...but not directly into the major.  You are technically in what PSU calls premajor status. To officially declare your major, you will have to successfully complete several courses with a C or better and hit a certain overall GPA, which varies depending on your major.  Civil engineering requires a 2.6 but biomedical, mechanical,  and chemical require a 3.2.  My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so.\n4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.

I was comparing the more quirky and irreverent student body of a place like Stanford, with a definite west cost vibe and lifestyle, and contrasting that with the more east coast, (in my opinion, somewhat more uptight) preppy vibe of a place like Princeton.\nThis is what I said: \"\"Stanford has a very west coast feel \u2013 its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have \u201c[appreciated] the \u2026 \u2018preppy\u2019 vibe.\u201d\nI cannot comment on the quarter vs. semester system and how that works with athletics, but quarters do move at a fast pace.

More suburban than urban, IMO. And Princeton is, indeed, a beautiful hamlet.\nYale, Columbia, NYU, Northeastern, U.Chicago are urban.

It seems like you\u2019ve gotten a lot of perspective from people (I saw topics on other websites as well), though I will say a lot of it is JHU focused simply by nature of them being a much larger school. I could see a lot of misconceptions regarding Pomona with the perspectives detailed (including the one above), but at this point I don\u2019t really find it worthwhile to \u201cdispute\u201d points raised. If anything, they can give you a sense for what colleagues and friends might perceive a degree from a top LAC to mean, whether or not that\u2019s grounded in anything true. If the opinions of others is something which especially matters to you, and you want to impress others with your institution, then there is the appeal of Johns Hopkins which is widely renowned as a leading university. I will be honest with you that Pomona will not give you much in the way of immediate glamour, and not everyone can tolerate that. But as a recent graduate, I know I was able to have the best undergraduate experience there and can stand on my own accomplishments and perspectives rather than the public worth of my institution alone.\nNo point in overthinking this. Small LAC with the individual attention and undergrad-centered experiences, or big university with world-class professors and research? They are vastly different.

There are several CS grad school students at Stanford from JHU for instance.\nI worked for consulting at Bain & Co after MIT grad school and am now at Google as a product manager.  I was in the Ph.D. program at MIT but left with a fully funded master\u2019s after I determined I didn\u2019t want to stay another 4 years to complete the doctorate.\nThe factors for getting into a top graduate school with funding are research experience (first author publications help especially) and recommendations by notable professors. You will have no shortage of this at JHU with ample summer funding (see PURA and other funded research programs with JHU professors).  Test scores and GPA are next in importance.  Interviews will come into play as well.\nI had my selection of funded grad schools (Caltech, Stanford, MIT, Columbia, etc) when I applied.  I didn\u2019t graduate at the top of my class (had about a 3.7 GPA - average at JHU is about a 3.4 now).\nI started research sophomore year and got published in a few publications as did some of my classmates during junior year.  My professor earned his Ph.D. from Stanford and is a well respected researcher as are most professors at Hopkins.

Familiar with Baltimore and Atlanta and both\nstudent bodies\nGaTech by state law accepts over 50% Georgia students.  All valedictorians in Georgia get automatically accepted at GaTech IF their high school meets some criteria set by the Georgia Legislature.\nGaTech is more fun loving student body, and less intense workload  than JHU.   Gatech has an excellent collaboration with Emory and a shuttle bus for BME students who want to work with medical doctors.\nI would choose GaTech over JHU for the social aspects of undergraduate education.\nRemember a BME undergrad  is going to either get a PhD or go to medical school, so getting plenty more education at least four more years of med school or six more years of research and classes for a PhD.\nThe rank difference is not that big between JHU and GaTech.  GaTech is arguably better for the design aspects of BME, the mechanical engineering side of BME.\nSystems biology, maybe a bit better at JHU, if you are looking for research work.  GaTech is particularly good at imaging sciences, tissue research, see their materials science and chemical engineering department, and of course anything related to design is superb at GaTech.\nEngineering overall is better at GaTech compared to JHU if thats your bent as well.\nCaltech is in a class by itself, with mathematics thats way more advanced, so a student needs to have mastered Calculus 3, and even part of differential equations to be able to earn Bs at Caltech in freshman math.  It starts with Analysis.  Caltech freshman have typically passed a college level physics class and that is assumed knowledge to start beginning required physics at Caltech, required for every major there.\nGaTech, if you score a 7/7 on IB Physics, you can place out of freshman physics, if you want to and take a more advanced physics class, or repeat as you see fit.  Physics is not the hardest class you will take at GaTech,probably, if you are taking freshman physics.\nJHU and GaTech are not as challenging (ball busting???)  as Caltech in physics and mathematics.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: North Carolina State University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYou may want to investigate how challenging each program is\u2026meaning how bad are the weed out courses.

That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay.\n@Alexandre Your good at making stuff up and presenting it as factual.\"\"\nI am merely stating a statistical reality. If you look at average starting salaries at Cornell, Michigan, Northwestern or Penn, there is an increase of 3%-4% annually. For example, the average Penn starting salary for the SEAS in 2012 was $69,000, 2013 was $72,000, 2014 was $75,000, in 2015 was $83,000 and in 2016 was $88,000. Since Cornell\u2019s report is for 2017 graduates, while Michigan\u2019s and Penn\u2019s report is for 2016 graduates, the comparison isn\u2019t entirely fair.\n\u201cAlso failing to normalize for size, UMich has 5 times as many engineering students as Penn. that would put Penn at nearly 200 vs 149 for UMich after a simple normalization\u2026\u201d\nPenn lists 68 CS majors out of the 177 who reported their placement and salaries from the SEAS at Penn, compared to 110 CS majors out of the 406 who reported their placement and salaries from the CoE  at Michigan. So it is nowhere near five times more. Like I said, Michigan\u2019s College of Engineering (roughly 6,500 undergraduate students) is 4 times larger than Penn\u2019s SEAS (close to 1,700 undergraduate students, so not 5 times larger), but when it comes to CS majors, Michigan and Penn have roughly the same numbers. As I stated above, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of engineering majors than Penn, which seems to focus disproportionately in CS/CE.  Even if you adjust for size, Michigan places a significantly higher number of graduates as Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft than Penn.\n\u201c\u2026but I did meet a UMich grad working at the Genious Bar so Apple does hire them.\u201d\nHehe! You got it there!

Familiar with Baltimore and Atlanta and both\nstudent bodies\nGaTech by state law accepts over 50% Georgia students.  All valedictorians in Georgia get automatically accepted at GaTech IF their high school meets some criteria set by the Georgia Legislature.\nGaTech is more fun loving student body, and less intense workload  than JHU.   Gatech has an excellent collaboration with Emory and a shuttle bus for BME students who want to work with medical doctors.\nI would choose GaTech over JHU for the social aspects of undergraduate education.\nRemember a BME undergrad  is going to either get a PhD or go to medical school, so getting plenty more education at least four more years of med school or six more years of research and classes for a PhD.\nThe rank difference is not that big between JHU and GaTech.  GaTech is arguably better for the design aspects of BME, the mechanical engineering side of BME.\nSystems biology, maybe a bit better at JHU, if you are looking for research work.  GaTech is particularly good at imaging sciences, tissue research, see their materials science and chemical engineering department, and of course anything related to design is superb at GaTech.\nEngineering overall is better at GaTech compared to JHU if thats your bent as well.\nCaltech is in a class by itself, with mathematics thats way more advanced, so a student needs to have mastered Calculus 3, and even part of differential equations to be able to earn Bs at Caltech in freshman math.  It starts with Analysis.  Caltech freshman have typically passed a college level physics class and that is assumed knowledge to start beginning required physics at Caltech, required for every major there.\nGaTech, if you score a 7/7 on IB Physics, you can place out of freshman physics, if you want to and take a more advanced physics class, or repeat as you see fit.  Physics is not the hardest class you will take at GaTech,probably, if you are taking freshman physics.\nJHU and GaTech are not as challenging (ball busting???)  as Caltech in physics and mathematics.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Boston College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAlso assuming costs are same or not part of your decision.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Princeton University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n\n[quote]\noh btw\u2026 the Harvard football team also passed around a list of easy classes to take\u2026 they had a name for it which eludes me now so I wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\n[/quote]\n\nMining for Gems.\nAdditionally, it\u2019s not only football players at Harvard that look to balance out the workload with an easier class here and there.

Given the huge disparity in total net costs, I think it is an easy decision if the OP is pretty certain of med school and if the prospects of getting into a good med school between Madison and Yale are equivalent, absent OP\u2019s family being so wealthy that the extra quarter million bucks \u00b1 is immaterial to them.  If, however, the prospects of med school are not so certain, the calculus does change somewhat.  Then it is a question of what Madison offers as likely alternatives to Yale in other departments/interests both academically and student life-wise.  Here we have 2 very different institutions.  The OP may thrive in both or one may offer a superior fit vs. the other.  Besides money, we have to consider the value of the experience for 4 very critical years that OP can never get back.\nI shared a personal anecdote on another similar thread involving Georgia Tech vs Harvard.  My brother chose to go to an honors program of a top public institution.  He ended up at a great med school and then on to residency at one of the top programs in his specialty.  He is very successful and happy.  He wanted to be a doctor from childhood. However, I am only aware of one friend of his from undergrad that he maintains regular contact with. I, on the other hand, had no clue what I wanted to do/be entering college.  I did not decide on a major until junior year.  Going to law school was almost a default.  My closest friends these days though are predominantly my buddies from Yale.  About a dozen of us still take an annual boys\u2019 long weekend trip each year.  They are successful doctors, lawyers, bankers, engineers, business owners and journalists \u2013 I think we have all made each other smarter and better people.  So for me, the money my family invested in Yale was well worth it.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nYes but in order to justify going back there we would have to adopt someone to take to another graduation dinner there.\nAnd I don\u2019t see it happening.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Brown University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@JenniferClint\nFair point perhaps, but Guggenheim Partners is not a Bulge Bracket.\nEdit: forgot that he was also CEO of Bear Sterns (former BB), my apologies\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Notre Dame\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Virginia\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nGet good grades, get involved in clubs and you\u2019ll have no problem.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Franklin W.

However, I often do warn that it is too teeny./limited (85 grads per hear) for most students.    If you want a more traditional college experience, GT may be better.   For completeness I will add more info about Olin too.\nOlin grads do have decent prospects for internships and jobs.  The job fairs I think have more companies than annual graduates.   You may find this link helpful - http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/careers-graduate-studies/results/.    There will definitely be employers who have NOT heard of Olin, more so as you get further from Boston.   The various rankings can help mitigate that - http://www.olin.edu/about/rankings-awards/\nOlin does have many projects, especially compared to my Engineering program in 1980s.    It also has intense academics, but not in the traditional course sequences.   Many Olin admits are highly qualified - some have turned down offers MIT, Stanford, Princeton etc.  So there is a presumption that they already have a lot of AP/IB knowledge under their belt.\nOur son did do research at Olin (including the summer after Freshman year), but it was interwined with software engineering.  One project resulted in an award (with colleges that had more liberal arts kinds of CS than most STEM schools).  He also did poster presentation at a conference.  But these things were not due to intentional research focus - he intended to go to work, not grad school.\nThe first link above includes To grad schools s  (the qty may be out of  all grads to date - under 1000\u2026 and I think a minority apply to grad schools)\nHarvard University  25\nStanford 21\nMIT  20\nCarnegie Mellon University 18\nUniversity of California Berkeley 15\nCornell 12\nOlin students can also take classes at Babson (adjacent campus), Wellsley (campus loop bus), or Brandeis.\nI think the approach to have an Olin Candidate\u2019s Weekend  is wise.  (first cut of admits come to campus on one of 3 weekends) .    I was not able to attend, but DH (also an engineer) went. with DS\u2026 and after that, they both were smitten.\nIn Summary:  Olin can be a fine school if it is a good \u201cfit\u201d.    But it is a niche-fit, so students should careful study the pros/cons for their particular situation.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Stanford University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Southern California\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nOk.

Pomona, by virtue of its less pre-professional vibe (typical of LAC vs. U...), is bound to be less competitive overall. But that doesn't mean the kids majoring in whatever you choose will be more or less competitive at either school.\n\nThese are just some of the things you might consider. I would put academic fit first: majors, classes, distribution requirements/curricular style, class sizes, overall vibe if you can get a handle on it, etc. After that, think about the environment/setting and social vibe, dorms, etc.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Maryland\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nNo, but he  seems determined to not go to UMD , and that is a hard thing to get past.

Here are my impressions:\nBoth places have smart, qualified, motivated students and strong faculty so there\u2019s no bad choice on the academics.  Wash U is larger so there are more faculty and more courses available.  I don\u2019t know about the Poli Sci department at Bowdoin but the one at Wash U has an excellent reputation.  Humanities overall are good quality - it\u2019s much more than a pre-med program.\nWash U felt somewhat more pre-professional and applied than Bowdoin.  This is a matter of degree, not an absolute.\nBowdoin\u2019s student body feels quite preppy and sporty, although Bowdoin also cares about diversity - being an early adopter of test-optional admissions reflects that commitment.\nWash U has a LOT of Asian and Asian-American students, which may be a plus for you.\nFood is fantastic at both (at least by Western standards).\nHookup culture - you will find it anywhere.  And you will find students that are more geared towards serious relationships.  And you will find students that have yet to date.  Chances are, if you don\u2019t party, it will be easy to avoid hookup culture.\nPartying you will find anywhere but also it\u2019s easily avoided.  Both campuses will have outside speakers, concerts, and other events that don\u2019t involve drugs or alcohol.\nSocial media is not representative of student bodies as a whole.\nLocation: Access to Wash U is probably slightly easier.  You\u2019d likely fly in to Chicago and then a domestic flight to STL.  Public transportation (light rail and buses) is very good.  For Bowdoin, you\u2019d probably fly into Boston and then to Portland by train or air (Portland is a smaller airport with fewer flights) and then from Portland take a shuttle or train to campus.  St. Louis is definitely more urban (although Wash U is more suburban, surrounded by upscale residential neighborhoods and a shopping/restaurant/club area called the Delmar Loop which is within walking distance of campus).  There is also a huge and beautiful public park nearby with free zoo, museums, etc.  Given its a large metro area, internship opportunities nearby are likely to be more abundant than at Bowdoin.  Bowdoin is a small, safe, charming town.  If you like outdoor recreation, mountains and coastline are easy to access and the Bowdoin Outing Club is very active.\nBoth campuses have rail service right next door.  From Bowdoin you can take a train to Portland - medium-sized, picturesque, and nearby, or Boston, larger and farther away.  Light rail from Wash U can get you into the city of STL and from there, points farther afield.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Wesleyan University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgia Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIf you really want engineering, GATech is your better choice, unless you are okay with a 3-2 type of program.

The last two are really subjective, but it is worth mentioning that Olin has a very cooperative atmosphere. From all reports I have seen, GT is more of a competitive (if not quite cut throat) scene. There are no frats at Olin \u2013 and it would be difficult to imagine any greek organization ever happening there (not just because of their size, also because of their culture). On the other hand, Geek organizations thrive. There are no varsity sports at Olin. While both schools have traditions, at Olin they are still making traditions (\u201cyou get to be a giant instead of standing on the shoulders of giants\u201d). As far as research opportunities, Olin is undergraduate-only, First Year students are routinely involved in research. I\u2019m sure GT undergraduates get research opportunities, but it is undoubtedly much more difficult to find the opportunities.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Duke University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of California, Berkeley\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nAd hominem attack aside I just cited the 5 rankings I see most frequently referenced.

Richmond has over a 2 billion dollar endowment! Huge for such a small LAC. (Haverford\u2019s is about 500 mill). That\u2019s why Richmond is so generous with funds to travel, research, study abroad, etc.\nAs for being a token intellectual, my S, not a richmond Scholar, had a 34ACT/1520 Sat, mostly As (until slacking senior yr) in rigorous curriculum (finished AP calc BC in 11th grade and took a discrete math topic 12th, Phys C, all told 8-10 APs (depending on how you count them)), so there are plenty of \u201csmart\u201d kids there. And, the curriculum is rigorous. Our somewhat immature son thought he could get by with the approach he took in senior year high school and learned the hard way (bad 1st sem grades), he needs to really study.\nAs for law school, have you looked at Richmond\u2019s Philosophy, Politics, Economics and Law major? It\u2019s what drew our S to Richmond. Kids LOVE that major. If you\u2019re a Richmond Scholar, get a 3.8 or above GPA (which might be easier to get at Richmond than Haverford, idk) and take advantage of everything the school offers, you\u2019ll be well set for the LSATs and a top law school.\nLook into the first year Endeavors and sophomore scholars in residence programs.

All this worrying about what GPA/environment a school will GIVE some one as they try to pursue medical school always concerns me because it basically says: \u201cOh my success is mainly based upon others, and not what I do to study, learn, and develop myself professionally\u201d.  It is a red flag for me to see these posts with \u201cI have high stats from achieving well in high school, but I just want ease and am concerned about rigor\u201d because what you said is right, confidence is important, and I have seen it plus great work ethic and willingness to really think take many students a long way at even these very selective schools like Emory and Rochester. Weirdly enough, it often didn\u2019t even matter what their stats were relative to their \u201ccompetition\u201d unless they were extremely low versus it.  if they were remotely in ballpark and had developed good study habits, confidence, and a great attitude towards learning, many of these students (that I mentored) would perform well in what are considered hard renditions of courses.  And interestingly, there is a hierarchy (I explained this in another thread at Emory) where you have some key STEM professors that are known to be more intellectually challenging than average for both Emory or elite schools in general, yet they have garnered popular support (there are still students who avoid them, but usually they teach a slight majority of students when other sections are offered) among students because not only do they demand development very high analytical skills (assuming most students, especially younger ones don\u2019t have it), but because they teach the material in a very effective and engaging way, and are also very effective mentors of students no matter how large their section size is.\nGetting at least a B range grade in many of these professors\u2019 courses really means you learned at a high level and usually these instructors will write really strong recommendation letters for students who scored in that range that showed themselves developing well during the course (and even better ones for students they managed to keep up with after the class).  In same cases, that range of students may even be selected as TAs (A students are not always the only ones who are enthusiastic, and we all know some don\u2019t know how to teach or collaborate with students effectively).  As you said for your son at Rochester who went to med.  Students who at least engaged some of these courses and professors, would likely be a step ahead in some or many places in the pre-clinical sciences curriculum at medical schools.  In addition, Emory from what my friends and mentees who did it right told me from their experience, were very well prepped for those more research focused medical schools and MDPhD programs because so much of the life sciences curriculum (including biology which is notorious at most schools for being mostly about memorization throughout the whole thing) has migrated to a focus on research techniques, experimental design, data analysis, and just thinking like a scientist (so many of the most standard biology classes may require students to discuss and present primary literature in whatever field.  It is the best idea ever IMHO.  Even many sophomore level courses have it.  It sends the message that the field nor course are just about \u201cthe facts\u201d and also holds students accountable for the foundation they supposedly gained in intro. biology courses, because chances are if you forgot most things or got poor training, reading the literature is all the more challenging because it assumes readers know about a threshold of ideas and techniques already), things that help folks do well on the MCAT and ease transition into research labs.  In addition, students are much more likely to retain the material if it is put in context of real research and real life scenarios as opposed to it being a bunch of facts and details thrown at students for them to remember and regurgitate back.\nWe all know medical schools want a strong GPA, but I think it is important for incoming prospies to think about how they can achieve it (and no it need not be a 3.8 in most cases, as nice as that would be) without having to actively lower their exposure to the right type of rigor.  There is no point in completely compromising your learning outcomes and skill development for looking good on paper for medical schools.  There are ways to be strategic and studious (as most students going to selective schools are obviously smart, high achieving cookies)  to ensure that you can perform well in most cases, while optimizing learning outcomes.  And as I said, even those shooting for at least a 3.7 or 3.8 have room for error.  I mentored students with over a 3.85 that have gotten several B/B+ grades.  One guy was so bold he chose an uncomfortable non-STEM course where he knew a B was possible each semester just because he wanted to take the best professors or work on his writing.  These students were very talented and toughened themselves up though.  They developed great study skills by taking early courses that laid a foundation for them to do well in other challenging coursework in the future.  That way, they weren\u2019t totally screwed or shocked if they later  hit professors asking them to think outside the box or do even more (or different type) work than normal.\nTheir approach made me wonder about the motto of \"\"just build confidence as a freshmen by taking it easy:  I personally think this depends on the person, and for many who are confident and have a background/preparation to do otherwise, they may do themselves a service by really challenging themselves in a course or two as a freshmen.  Making that decision requires confidence, work ethic, a good attitude towards learning and feeling challenged (likely a growth mindset with respect to learning-  What you described with the algebra thing is a fixed mindset and unfortunately I think grade school teachers often play a role in conveying to students that \u201conly those with seemingly natural aptitude in an area can be truly successful\u201d which is likely why you have high achievers fearing for their life being amidst a bunch of people that make them look average or normal versus their achievements and test-taking ability) maturity, and something more than short-sighted goals of course.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Bates College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Middlebury College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@joy12345 my daughter has never felt an elitist vibe at Middelbury.

She did feel the environment was intense at Williams, that it had a similar feel to Swarthmore, and for that reason Williams did fall off of her list.

Since he referenced Amherst and Williams in specific, there are data points from the three schools showing that the salaries across these schools are similar (CollegeScoreCard & PayScale), that tech/consulting/other prestigious gigs recruit similarly from the Claremont Colleges, and that Pomona is similar in terms of students receiving competitive fellowships or getting a PhD. Maybe back in 2005 Pomona truly did suffer when it came to pre-professional opportunities, recruiting, and such, but that hasn\u2019t been my personal experience as a 2016 grad. I know Pomona definitely stepped up for funding internships and elevating career services in the four years I was there.

I don\u2019t think they are taking lower Stat kids like public schools do in general. For engineering their program is very limited.

My son is going into engineering to get into finance /business management. He really likes the way engineering is taught and makes you think at a different level. Again as stated, he is going back to Michigan tomorrow to do a week long leadership Capstone for their $10,000 grant. They will work with mentors also over the summer to come up with a business plan going forward. It's the first time they took a freshman group and Michigan is paying for an airbnb for the 3 of them for the week to be there....... This is how Michigan supports their students endeavors!\nFor those spitting out facts please read my two previous remarks in this thread.

They just have similar curricula design and ideas clearly) in life sciences and I would expect that math and physics courses that pre-healths/STEM majors have to take would at least be on the same level (I didn\u2019t look:  I usually assume that on average the level of intro. courses in those areas is higher at other schools of similar and higher selectivity because Emory\u2019s depts do not serve an engineering school and nor are they anchored to elite physics and math graduate program/research apparatuses like Chicago for example which is an exception to the engineering rule).\nSome differences to consider:\nChemistry;  Emory just changed its chemistry curriculum to bring in a decent amount of organic chemistry into the first year courses (including organic chemistry concepts most often covered in 2nd semester of organic chemistry).  It isn\u2019t a super hardcore introduction, but it is basically blended with traditional gen. chem concepts which you can learn about in these places:\nhttp://chemistry.emory.edu/articulate/chemistry_unbound/story_html5.html\nhttp://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/09/er_chemistry_curriculum/campus.html\nThese changes may not be well received by some (it is unclear if it is \u201cpre-med friendly\u201d as it kind of bucks traditional two year pre-med engagement with chemistry which is either 2 gen. chems and 2 ochems or 1 gen. chem, 2 ochems, and then biochem.  Emory\u2019s is close to a weird rendition of this latter version) but Emory\u2019s undergraduate chemistry program is known for unusual rigor regardless (even prior to the change).  I saw some of UR\u2019s stuff, and it seems like it would be at the level of a more \u201cstandard\u201d level classical general or organic chemistry course at Emory which is/was challenging for many but doable for most.  Admittedly the majority of students take less \u201cclassical\u201d instructors once the 3rd (a modern version of organic chemistry) and 4th (supposedly some mixture of material science and biochemical concepts\u2026I am not quite sure and nor does the publication or information above make it clear) pre-health courses are hit\nBiosciences:  They look similar, but Rochester is more classical (as in most schools selective or not do it like this) in arrangement.  It has molecular and cell first semester and more organismal biology/ecology second semester.  Emory\u2019s first semester is identical (actually they recently added in ecology/evolution concepts into the first semester and used it to re-frame the molecular cell stuff), and the second semester is basically a genetics course with a primary focus on molecular genetics and modern biotechnology/experimental biology concepts.  I don\u2019t think this difference changes difficulty because OP has AP credit in bio(?  Actually I don\u2019t know) and the AP bio curriculum has apparently changed to integrate more of the stuff Emory covers in its second semester, when it used to be more ecology/evolution heavy back in the dinosaur ages of 2008 when I took it.  I still remember being pleasantly surprised that Emory didn\u2019t just rehash all of that in the second semester and instead hit me with new content. However, current students/prospies will have been exposed to both styles.  What that does mean is that the actual genetics courses look a little different with UR covering the stuff Emory covered in gen. bio and Emory doing something a little different, veering towards human genetics (which means more coverage of epigenetics which we now know  relevant to human diseases now-a-days) and keeping the emphasis more on the experimental aspect as opposed to more math/classical genetics concepts.\nAppears Rochester has \u201crecitations\u201d for many intermediate biology classes.  I am unsure how they are used and how the associated lectures are run.  Usually when I think \u201crecitation\u201d I think review and maybe some out of lecture review (which at some schools apparently entails extra lecturing), problem solving, and quizzes, things that maybe the lecture component doesn\u2019t have time for.  Emory doesn\u2019t have these and instead has a big undergraduate TA mentoring and tutoring system which is associated with additional problem sets that are technically optional.  But this mainly applies to lower division courses/pre-med classes.  At the intermediate and advanced level, many biology courses do have \u201cdiscussion\u201d which is usually for reading and presenting primary literature, but is every so often used for other activities (for example evolutionary biology and math-based upper division courses may integrate a simulation/modelling exercise or something)\nAs much as it interests me, It shouldn\u2019t  really matter to a prospie(I usually think pedagogy and assessment style usually matter more than arrangement of content for most life sciences courses.  Admittedly chemistry is tricky, but I don\u2019t wanna go there right now).  Students should just get somewhere, learn the material to the highest level possible, and do the best they can. One can get the right type of challenge from Emory, Rochester, and many other places\u2026and even at gasp!  Much less \u201cprestigious\u201d undergraduate programs that have put lots of money into their STEM curricula and pedagogy.  UMD is an example:https://nexus.umbc.edu/  Several of its campus have implemented the NEXUS revamp of life sciences curricula.  I saw some materials resulting from it and they are damned good and are at just as high a level or higher than many \u201celite\u201d schools, especially those I saw from College Park.  So there are so many schools that one can find that are great for pre-healths because of the resources/opportunities AND because they pay exceptional levels of attention to how they deliver their STEM/pre-health courses.  It is very possible to be in a place that still challenges students in a useful way that isn\u2019t ultra competitive/super duper selective.  You just need to do the research.  One can have several pieces of cake and eat all of them.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nPenn has all the resources to make sure you succeed but you have to take advantage of them and work hard.

SMU is a beautiful campus in downtown Dallas, but it definitely had the feel of being more \u201ccampus-like\u201d to me than UT. I\u2019ve heard it is more preppy with an upper middle class/ \u201cwealthier\u201d status attached to it, but I didn\u2019t see a ton of that. IU has a beautiful college campus and the Kelley school is phenomenal as well. I\u2019ve heard employers love to hire Kelley kids.

I will say that the Pomona CS Department is struggling with the same issues as HMC\u2019s, which is demand that exceeds the amount of faculty available. Basically you have to be a CS major to have the necessary priority to get in classes. They will hold spaces in the introductory classes for the incoming freshmen, but after that you\u2019d better declare a CS major asap.\nMy D is an Econ major who is trying to complete a CS minor and she was shut out of the class she wanted last Spring semester as a junior. Generally cross-registration is easy and seamless but be aware that for your major some departments will require that you complete certain courses at Pomona (e.g., the Econ department requires that you take the 6 core classes for the major at Pomona). My D is currently doing an internship one of the Federal Reserve Banks. She\u2019s only been there a few days but her boss, a senior Research Economist at the Fed, told her that she is on the \u201cright tail\u201d in terms of the amount of research experience that his interns have had.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Rutgers University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nSorry, there is no way that Virginia Tech is a \u201csuper safety\u201d in engineering.

Can\u2019t go wrong! Each is a little different, and take my impresions with a grain of salt as they are subjective of course. I think (overall) all three schools are pretty equal in your academic areas of interest- some might be stronger than others in certain areas but overall it\u2019s relative as all three are top notch schools.\nBates- wonderful community. Gorgeous (although small) campus/architecture. Very friendly vibe, students are welcoming and the close knit community feel is palpable. Strong academics, just a lovely school. Has the month long May plan which is useful for starting summer internships early or for traveling abroad. Major difference to me between it and the other two is a more laid back vibe. Doesn\u2019t feel as intense. Definitely collaborative. Best food of the three. Nephew is a current student. D15 would have applied regular decision if her ED school had fallen through. Bates is very high on D18\u2019s list this year.\nBowdoin- neat school. Lovely campus in it\u2019s own quirky way. Location near Portland is nice, it is more suburban than rural if that matters to you. Great if you like the ocean. Pretty far away from mountains though if you like having them in your back yard. Of course great academics. Personally, I sensed a little more academic elitism at Bowdoin than the other three. I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, and perhaps I have used the wrong word. Just seemed a little bit more academcially snobby than the other two. Not sure how collaborative/competitive, don\u2019t know enough kids who go there.  D15 liked Bowdoin a lot, would have applied if her ED school fell through. D18 didn\u2019t even look at Bowdoin, too intense of a school for her.\nMiddlebury- awesome location in the mountains, lovely campus. Feels considerably bigger than the other two schools. D15 went ED and attends. Loving her expereince, it is the right mix of academic intensity and fun for her. Raves about (most) of the professors/classes she has taken. Has found Midd more collaborative than competitive (she is env policy major). Heavily involved in the Mountain Club. Knows women on the cross country/track team and they are a great group. Jan Plan is very popular- fun to have the one block class in the middle of ski season. Lots of students ski. D18 not interested in Midd, a bit too intense for her.\nGood luck!\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: North Carolina State University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@4gsmom thanks for the feedback.

So the campus is going to feel really, really, empty. I believe most professors will be on campus and academic buildings should be open from 8-5- I\u2019d recommend emailing in advance to schedule a meeting (they might have some students as well that you could talk to). The admissions office does hold tours and info sessions at 9/10/11 AM and it could be a nice way to connect with the officers. Definitely make your way up to the other Claremont Colleges up north to get a sense of how close they are (also, if there are professors at the other schools whose work interests you, you could speak to them as well). The library should be open as well. Have a great visit \n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Indiana University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Southern Methodist University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nOK, here is the WSJ ranking:\nhttp://collegematchus.com/ranking-the-colleges-top-colleges-that-feed-alumni-into-grad-school-programs/\nThe top professional schools are listed here:\nhttp://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2007/08/wall-street-jou.html\nDefinitely an East-Coast bias (possibly because Stanford wasn\u2019t willing to share data?)\nI know that in business, the top MBA programs are the M7 (Stanford, HBS, Wharton, Chicago Booth, MIT Sloan, Columbia, Northwestern Kellogg) while for law, YHS-CCN are the top 6.\nOf those 13, the breakdown between East Coast, Midwest, and West Coast is 8-3-2.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Washington University in St. Louis\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Bowdoin College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nI am sad for you.

Having a lad in med school and seeing the work required there to do well becoming a doctor anyone would want to see, if you\u2019re worried about the rigor in undergrad classes you\u2019re probably best finding a different career plan.\nTaking what is perceived to be the \u201ceasy\u201d route (according to the candidate) is one med school admissions frowns upon (as told to us by med school admissions reviewers when the above mentioned lad was contemplating pre-med), so you might want to consider rewording questions, etc.\nYour best odds at getting into med school come from your putting in the effort studying to get good grades and an MCAT score while simultaneously getting the experiences needed within the medical field. I\u2019ve seen students do this from many different schools - small religious LACs to large state schools and anything in between.  The common denominator is they worked to do it (and had the ability to do it), not which school they went to.  Their applications were attractive due to their accomplishments - not due to anyone freely giving them something.\nI see very little difference between Emory and U Roc as destinations for undergrad.  What you do at either will be the tipping point.  Definitely consider finances as med school is expensive.  Definitely consider what you \u201clike\u201d because students often do better where they are happier.  Consider what your Plan B is too.  Every potential med school candidate should have one as many do not make it in.

In other words, is it a short-term or a long-term goal?\nWill you be an average or top contributor at P, at S?\nHave you done any research on which college supports athletes better adapt to rigorous academic environment? What are their graduation success rate like? (These are available from their respective athletic depts.)\nRegarding academic life:\nDo you prefer a larger school setting or a smaller LAC-like school? For comparison, Stanford has about 2,000 more undergrad students than Princeton, which has about 5,200. Stanford\u2019s grad student population is about 11,000 whereas Princeton\u2019s grad student population is about half of its undergrad population at 2,700. Stanford has Med, Law and Business schools. By institutional design, Princeton doesn\u2019t. There are pros and cons to either environment, and it\u2019s up to each individual student preference.\nWhat do you intend to major in? Which school has greater strength in your area of academic interest? What resources does each school have for assisting you towards your career path given your major?\nWhat pedagogical style do you prefer? Princeton has the Preceptorial Method which is a modified Oxford tutorial learning environment with 5:1 student-teacher ratio. I\u2019m not as familiar with Stanford\u2019s pedagogical methods, so I\u2019ll leave that for other knowledgeable folks to contribute here.\nPrinceton has residential college (6) system, and each college where you\u2019d be housed is staffed by 1) the college dean, 2) director of studies, 3) faculty advisers, 4) peer academic advisers and 5) director of student life, a staff member dedicated to support your health and well being. Again, I\u2019m not familiar with Stanford counterpart to this so I\u2019ll leave this up to others to contribute here.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these great institutions. However, they\u2019re very different in culture and experience, so do make a wise decision based on YOUR personality and needs. One big mistake I\u2019ve seen so many young students make is going with what their peers think are a greater choice when instead they need to really dig into their self-knowledge of who they\u2019re and what they want to accomplish in life. In other words, DON\u2019T go with either the Ivy hype or the Stanford hype. Go with what\u2019d fulfill your life in the long run.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Boston College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Georgetown University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nHave you run net price calcs for both?

Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful.\nCornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application.\nAs for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent.

Changing topics slightly, when you\u2019re looking at statistics about graduate schools and Olin try to factor in that many Olin students do some time in the workforce and then head for graduate school. They have an office of \u201cPost Graduate Planning,\u201d that assists students with post Olin planning and strategy (http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/careers-graduate-studies/). Finally, definitely check out the way Olin has produced Fulbright scholars. It may be interesting to compare Olin and GT by Fulbright recipients (while taking Olin\u2019s smaller size into consideration). I haven\u2019t seen the comparison.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Franklin W.

He took one course at Wellesley, but it was a math course he wanted to take (not a required course).    There can be logistics with cross-registration due to slightly different break schedules and timeslot alignment (many Olin courses only have one section).    He also did a semester abroad, but that needs to be planned carefully to ensure all the graduation requirements are met.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Smith College\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Haverford College\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nThe challenge of sports as a decision variable is that it is really hard to guess which kid is going to stay with their sport when they get to college. We have seen so many, many students who were 100% sure that they were going to be just as committed to their sport in college as they were in HS, and then drop it before the end of the first year. Not to mention the ones who get injured and have to stop playing.\nHaverford & Smith are different enough that I would go by how she feels when she is on campus: go for the overall fit first: it is likely to matter longer than the sport angle. .\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nEqual preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, OP has not responded to any of the suggestions here.  Its very likely none of the advice resonates with his situation. We know very little about OP\u2019s intended majors or family finance, we are not even certain if he was already accepted at both schools.  But a few things were clear: OP\u2019s family is in 250K+ range (that\u2019s MIT full pay threshold) and OP would choose MIT if there were no price differential.\nIf OP is offered MIT EA and UM full ride he is such a high achiever that he is likely to have a mid career income 300K+ twenty years from now. For a person having a future earning $250k+/yr for 25+ years a $250k difference does not look so big. As @Much2learn suggested people who think MIT new grad being offered more than $200k total compension is out of the norm are probably out of touch with today\u2019s job market. I know a few MIT kids who have received multi-million dollar funding from VCs while still in college.  There are possibilities that MIT undergrad experience may offer but they hardly exist at UM.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nB is preferred over A", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Pennsylvania State University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Virginia Tech\n```\n\n```\nComment:\n@ppxyz123 yes.

For most engineering disciplines, any school in the top 10ish will be recruited comparably for jobs in their field right out of undergrad.  BMEs feel the difference, however.  Some of my best friends are BMEs (I know people at Johns Hopkins [#2 BME], Michigan [#9 BME], and Rutgers [#? BME]), and they and can attest to that.\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: University of Pennsylvania\n```\n\n```\nOption B: Yale University\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nWhat are your preferences in terms of campus culture?\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nNo preference", "### System:\nPretend that you are a user on college confidential forums.\nYour job is to detect if there exists a preference between two options in a comment. \nIf there exists a preference, you must detect what the preference is.\nIf the author of the comment expresses an explicit preference, you must detect it.\nYou will be given a comment and two alternatives for each task.\nThe options will be denoted by ```Option A:``` and ```Option B:```.\nThe comment will be denoted by ```Comment:```.\nYou MUST respond using only the following phrases:\n- ```No preference``` if there is no strict preference.\n- ```A is preferred over B``` if option A is preferred over option B.\n- ```B is preferred over A``` if option B is preferred over option A.\n- ```Equal preference``` if options A and B are equally preferred.\n\n\n### User:\n```\nOption A: Cornell University\n```\n\n```\nOption B: University of Michigan\n```\n\n```\nComment:\nsoymilk27  a math major is different by far than a business major. Worry a lot more about do you really want a mathematics major at Cornell, and why not at Michigan?  Mathematics majors will require you to work hard. An undergraduate business degree is less valuable down the road,  in comparison,  unless you are taking a lot of quantitative classes.   At Michigan I take it you would take a lot of math though.       Do you want an MBA? Then the harder major of mathematics will go a long way if its paired with a great job option in NYC later, for a few years and then your application to Wharton etc.  Cornell is very tied to New York city and opening a new campus on Roosevelt Island , Cornell Tech.  Look into Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island. Its located at Google in NYC right now.    Its pretty far from the Ithaca campus, but looks interesting to me:\nhttps://tech.cornell.edu/\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Response:\nA is preferred over B"]
